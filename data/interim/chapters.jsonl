In both countries it was clearer\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and \u0002shes, that\nthings in general were settled for ever.\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and\nseventy-\u0002ve. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that\nfavoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her\n\u0002ve-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in\nthe Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing\nthat arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and\nWestminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round\ndozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very\nyear last past (supernaturally de\u0002cient in originality) rapped out theirs.\nMere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the En-\nglish Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:\nwhich, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race\nthan any communications yet received through any of the chickens of\nthe Cock-lane brood.\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some \u0002fty or sixty yards.\nIt is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway,\nthere were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already\nmarked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards,\nto make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it,\nterrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of\nsome tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered\nfrom the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire,\nsnuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer,\nDeath, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But\nthat Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work\nsilently, and no one heard them as they went about with muf\u0003ed tread:\nthe rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake,\nwas to be atheistical and traitorous.\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families\nwere publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their\nfurniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in\nthe dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\nthe Captain, gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\nmall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, in consequence of the fail-\nure of his ammunition: after which the mall was robbed in peace; that\nmagni\u0002cent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols\nfought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law \u0002red blun-\nderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves\nsnipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court\ndrawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contra-\nband goods, and the mob \u0002red on the musketeers, and the musketeers\n\u0002red on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much\nout of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\nand ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\nup long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker\non Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in\nthe hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the\ndoor of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious mur-\nderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's\nboy of sixpence.\nAll these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and\nclose upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-\n\u0002ve. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked\nunheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain\nand the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\nwith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and\nseventy-\u0002ve conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures\nthe creatures of this chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay\nbefore them.", "index": 0}
{"sub_book_number": "First", "sub_book_title": "Recalled to Life", "chapter_number": 2, "chapter_title": "The Mail", "chapter_text": "It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\nbefore the \u0002rst of the persons with whom this history has business. The\nDover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\nShooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as\nthe rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for\nwalking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the\nharness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses\nhad three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach\nacross the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.\nReins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination,\nhad read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly\nin favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with\nReason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.\nWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way\nthrough the thick mud, \u0003oundering and stumbling between whiles, as\nif they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver\nrested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary Wo-ho! so-ho-\nthen! the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it\nlike an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got\nup the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started,\nas a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\nThere was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in\nits forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and \u0002nding\nnone. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through\nthe air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as\nthe waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to\nshut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own\nworkings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses\nsteamed into it, as if they had made it all.\nTwo other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by\nthe side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over\nthe ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said,\nfrom anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each\nwas hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind,\nas from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, trav-\nellers were very shy of being con\u0002dential on a short notice, for anybody\non the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the lat-\nter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody\nin the Captain's pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\nnon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of\nthe Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-\u0002ve, lumbering up Shooter's Hill,\nas he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\nand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\nloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\ndeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\nThe Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard sus-\npected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the\nguard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure\nof nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear con-\nscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not \u0002t\nfor the journey.\nWo-ho! said the coachman. So, then! One more pull and you're\nat the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get\nyou to it!Joe!\nHalloa! the guard replied.\nWhat o'clock do you make it, Joe?\nTen minutes, good, past eleven.\nMy blood! ejaculated the vexed coachman, and not atop of\nShooter's yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!\nThe emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided nega-\ntive, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\nsuit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of\nits passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the\ncoach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the\nthree had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little\nahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair\nway of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.\nThe last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\nstopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\nthe descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\nTst! Joe! cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down\nfrom his box.\nWhat do you say, Tom?\nThey both listened.\nI say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.\nI say a horse at a gallop, Tom, returned the guard, leaving his\nhold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. Gentlemen! In the\nkings name, all of you!\nWith this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood\non the offensive.\nThe passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, get-\nting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to\nfollow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of;\nthey re-mained in the road below him. They all looked from the coach-\nman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.\nThe coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the\nemphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contra-\ndicting.\nThe stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labour-\ning of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\nindeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion\nto the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the pas-\nsengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet\npause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the\nbreath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\nThe sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\nSo-ho! the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. Yo there!\nStand! I shall \u0002re!\nThe pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and \u0003oun-\ndering, a man's voice called from the mist, Is that the Dover mail?\nNever you mind what it is! the guard retorted. What are you?\nIs that the Dover mail?\nWhy do you want to know?\nI want a passenger, if it is.\nWhat passenger?\nMr. Jarvis Lorry.\nOur booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.\nThe guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him dis-\ntrustfully.\nKeep where you are, the guard called to the voice in the mist,\nbecause, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your\nlifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.\nWhat is the matter? asked the passenger, then, with mildly qua-\nvering speech. Who wants me? Is it Jerry?\n(I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry, growled the guard to himself.\nHe's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.)\nYes, Mr. Lorry.\nWhat is the matter?\nA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\nI know this messenger, guard, said Mr. Lorry, getting down into\nthe roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other\ntwo passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the\ndoor, and pulled up the window. He may come close; there's nothing\nwrong.\nI hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that, said\nthe guard, in gruff soliloquy. Hallo you!\nWell! And hallo you! said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\nCome on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters\nto that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm\na devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of\nLead. So now let's look at you.\nThe \u0002gures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying\nmist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The\nrider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passen-\nger a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse\nand rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat\nof the man.\nGuard! said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business con\u0002dence.\nThe watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\nblunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, an-\nswered curtly, Sir.\nThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You\nmust know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business.\nA crown to drink. I may read this?\nIf so be as you're quick, sir.\nHe opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read\n\u0002rst to himself and then aloud:  `Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.' It's not\nlong, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, recalled to life.\nJerry started in his saddle. That's a Blazing strange answer, too,\nsaid he, at his hoarsest.\nTake that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\nwell as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.\nWith those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in;\nnot at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously se-\ncreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a\ngeneral pretence of being asleep. With no more de\u0002nite purpose than to\nescape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.\nThe coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing\nround it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunder-\nbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents,\nand having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\nlooked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few\nsmith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was fur-\nnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\nand stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\nhimself up inside, keep the \u0003int and steel sparks well off the straw, and\nget a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in \u0002ve min-\nutes.\nTom! softly over the coach roof.\nHallo, Joe.\nDid you hear the message?\nI did, Joe.\nWhat did you make of it, Tom?\nNothing at all, Joe.\nThat's a coincidence, too, the guard mused, for I made the same\nof it myself.\nJerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile,\nnot only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and\nshake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding\nabout half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-\nsplashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing\nand the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.\nAfter that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your\nfore-legs till I get you on the level, said this hoarse messenger, glancing\nat his mare.  `Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange message. Much\nof that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing\nbad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!", "index": 1}
{"sub_book_number": "First", "sub_book_title": "Recalled to Life", "chapter_number": 3, "chapter_title": "The Night Shadows", "chapter_text": "A wonderful fact to re\u0003ect upon, that every human creature is consti-\ntuted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn\nconsideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those\ndarkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every\none of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hun-\ndreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret\nto the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself,\nis referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that\nI loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into\nthe depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights\nglanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things\nsubmerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring,\nfor ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that\nthe water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was play-\ning on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is\ndead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it\nis the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was\nalways in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's\nend. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is\nthere a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their\ninnermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?\nAs to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the mes-\nsenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the\n\u0002rst Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the\nthree passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old\nmail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each\nhad been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the\nbreadth of a county between him and the next.\nThe messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at\nale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his\nown counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes\nthat assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black,\nwith no depth in the colour or form, and much too near togetheras\nif they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept\ntoo far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat\nlike a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muf\u0003er for the chin and\nthroat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped\nfor drink, he moved this muf\u0003er with his left hand, only while he poured\nhis liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muf\u0003ed again.\nNo, Jerry, no! said the messenger, harping on one theme as he\nrode. It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it\nwouldn't suit your line of business! Recalled! Bust me if I don't think\nhe'd been a drinking!\nHis message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, sev-\neral times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,\nwhich was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all\nover it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was\nso like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked\nwall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have\ndeclined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.\nWhile he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the\nnight watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar,\nwho was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the\nnight took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took\nsuch shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness.\nThey seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.\nWhat time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped\nupon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,\nlikewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their\ndozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.\nTellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger\nwith an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in\nit to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving\nhim into his corner, whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in\nhis place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-\nlamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite\npassenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The\nrattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were\nhonoured in \u0002ve minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and\nhome connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms\nunderground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets\nas were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew\nabout them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the\ngreat keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and\nstrong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.\nBut, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the\ncoach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was\nalways with him, there was another current of impression that never\nceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one\nout of a grave.\nNow, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before\nhim was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did\nnot indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of \u0002ve-and-forty by\nyears, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and\nin the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, de-\n\u0002ance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\nso did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands\nand \u0002gures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was\nprematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of\nthis spectre:\nBuried how long?\nThe answer was always the same: Almost eighteen years.\nYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\nLong ago.\nYou know that you are recalled to life?\nThey tell me so.\nI hope you care to live?\nI can't say.\nShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?\nThe answers to this question were various and contradictory. Some-\ntimes the broken reply was, Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too\nsoon. Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it\nwas, Take me to her. Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and\nthen it was, I don't know her. I don't understand.\nAfter such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would\ndig, and dig, dignow with a spade, now with a great key, now with\nhis handsto dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth\nhanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust.\nThe passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to\nget the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.\nYet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the\nmoving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside\nretreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into\nthe train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Tem-\nple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the\nreal express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be\nthere. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he\nwould accost it again.\nBuried how long?\nAlmost eighteen years.\nI hope you care to live?\nI can't say.\nDigdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two\npassengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm\nsecurely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slum-\nbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid\naway into the bank and the grave.\nBuried how long?\nAlmost eighteen years.\nYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\nLong ago.\nThe words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his\nhearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary\npassenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the\nshadows of the night were gone.\nHe lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was\na ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left\nlast night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,\nin which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained\nupon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,\nand the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.\nEighteen years! said the passenger, looking at the sun. Gracious\nCreator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!", "index": 2}
{"sub_book_number": "First", "sub_book_title": "Recalled to Life", "chapter_number": 4, "chapter_title": "The Preparation", "chapter_text": "When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\nthe head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as\nhis custom was. He did it with some \u0003ourish of ceremony, for a mail\njourney from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an\nadventurous traveller upon.\nBy that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be con-\ngratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\nroadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\nand dirty straw, its disageeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like\na larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it\nin chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, \u0003apping hat, and muddy\nlegs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\nThere will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?\nYes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\ntide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?\nI shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.\nAnd then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show\nConcord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentle-\nman's boots in Concord. (You will \u0002nd a \u0002ne sea-coal \u0002re, sir.) Fetch\nbarber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!\nThe Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by\nthe mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up\nfrom head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment\nof the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go\ninto it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, an-\nother drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were\nall loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Con-\ncord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed\nin a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with\nlarge square cuffs and large \u0003aps to the pockets, passed along on his\nway to his breakfast.\nThe coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the\ngentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the \u0002re, and\nas he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so\nstill, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.\nVery orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee,\nand a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his \u0003apped waist-\ncoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\nevanescence of the brisk \u0002re. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\nof it, for his brown stockings \u0002tted sleek and close, and were of a \u0002ne\ntexture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore\nan odd little sleek crisp \u0003axen wig, setting very close to his head: which\nwig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more\nas though it were spun from \u0002laments of silk or glass. His linen, though\nnot of a \u0002neness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the\ntops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks\nof sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed\nand quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist\nbright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some\npains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank.\nHe had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore\nfew traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the con\u0002dential bachelor clerks in\nTellson's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people;\nand perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily\noff and on.\nCompleting his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his por-\ntrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused\nhim, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\nI wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come\nhere at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may\nonly ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know.\nYes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?\nYes.\nYes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentle-\nmen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and\nParis, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's\nHouse.\nYes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.\nYes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\nsir?\nNot of late years. It is \u0002fteen years since wesince Icame last\nfrom France.\nIndeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's\ntime here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.\nI believe so.\nBut I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\nCompany was \u0003ourishing, a matter of \u0002fty, not to speak of \u0002fteen years\nago?\nYou might treble that, and say a hundred and \u0002fty, yet not be far\nfrom the truth.\nIndeed, sir!\nRounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward\nfrom the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his\nleft, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest\nwhile he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. Accord-\ning to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\nWhen Mr. Lorry had \u0002nished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll\non the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\nfrom the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine os-\ntrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly\nabout, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.\nIt thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the\ncoast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a pisca-\ntory \u0003avour that one might have supposed sick \u0002sh went up to be dipped\nin it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little \u0002shing\nwas done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and\nlooking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and\nwas near \u0003ood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, some-\ntimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that\nnobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\nAs the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\nat intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\nagain charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to\ncloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room \u0002re,\nawaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily\ndigging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.\nA bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\nharm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\nMr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\nglassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever\nto be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got\nto the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\nstreet, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\nHe set down his glass untouched. This is Mam'selle! said he.\nIn a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss\nManette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gen-\ntleman from Tellson's.\nSo soon?\nMiss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required\nnone then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tell-\nson's immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\nThe gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty\nhis glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little \u0003axen wig\nat the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment. It was a\nlarge, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair,\nand loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled,\nuntil the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were\ngloomily re\u0003ected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of\nblack mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them\nuntil they were dug out.\nThe obscurity was so dif\u0002cult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking\nhis way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed\nMiss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until,\nhaving got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him\nby the table between them and the \u0002re, a young lady of not more than\nseventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by\nits ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty \u0002gure,\na quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an\ninquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering\nhow young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an\nexpression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm,\nor merely of a bright \u0002xed attention, though it included all the four\nexpressions-as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness\npassed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the\npassage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted\nheavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath\nalong the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of\nwhich, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all\ncripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities\nof the feminine gender-and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\nPray take a seat, sir. In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\nlittle foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\nI kiss your hand, miss, said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an\nearlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\nI received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\nsome intelligenceor discovery\nThe word is not material, miss; either word will do.\nrespecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never\nsawso long dead\nMr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\nhospital procession of negro cupids. As if they had any help for anybody\nin their absurd baskets!\nrendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communi-\ncate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris\nfor the purpose.\nMyself.\nAs I was prepared to hear, sir.\nShe curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days),\nwith a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and\nwiser he was than she. He made her another bow.\nI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\nthose who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go\nto France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could\ngo with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place\nmyself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection.\nThe gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after\nhim to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.\nI was happy, said Mr. Lorry, to be entrusted with the charge. I\nshall be more happy to execute it.\nSir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told\nme by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of\nthe business, and that I must prepare myself to \u0002nd them of a surprising\nnature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\nstrong and eager interest to know what they are.\nNaturally, said Mr. Lorry. YesI\nAfter a pause, he added, again settling the crisp \u0003axen wig at the\nears, It is very dif\u0002cult to begin.\nHe did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\nforehead lifted itself into that singular expressionbut it was pretty\nand characteristic, besides being singularand she raised her hand, as\nif with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\nshadow.\nAre you quite a stranger to me, sir?\nAm I not? Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them out-\nwards with an argumentative smile.\nBetween the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line\nof which was as delicate and \u0002ne as it was possible to be, the expression\ndeepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\nshe had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and\nthe moment she raised her eyes again, went on:\nIn your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address\nyou as a young English lady, Miss Manette?\nIf you please, sir.\nMiss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\nacquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than\nif I was a speaking machine-truly, I am not much else. I will, with your\nleave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.\nStory!\nHe seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he\nadded, in a hurry, Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually\ncall our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scien-\nti\u0002c gentleman; a man of great acquirementsa Doctor.\nNot of Beauvais?\nWhy, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\ngentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\ngentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him\nthere. Our relations were business relations, but con\u0002dential. I was at\nthat time in our French House, and had beenoh! twenty years.\nAt that timeI may ask, at what time, sir?\nI speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He marriedan English lady\nand I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\nFrench gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.\nIn a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\nscores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there\nis no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.\nI have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life,\njust as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my\nbusiness day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go\non\nBut this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to thinkthe curi-\nously roughened forehead was very intent upon himthat when I was\nleft an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,\nit was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.\nMr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that con\u0002dingly advanced\nto take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then\nconducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding\nthe chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his\nchin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down\ninto her face while she sat looking up into his.\nMiss Manette, it was I. And you will see how truly I spoke of\nmyself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations\nI hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you\nre\u0003ect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward\nof Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business\nof Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\nof them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\nMangle.\nAfter this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr.\nLorry \u0003attened his \u0003axen wig upon his head with both hands (which\nwas most unnecessary, for nothing could be \u0003atter than its shining sur-\nface was before), and resumed his former attitude.\nSo far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regret-\nted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when\nhe didDon't be frightened! How you start!\nShe did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.\nPray, said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand\nfrom the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory \u0002ngers that\nclasped him in so violent a tremble: pray control your agitationa\nmatter of business. As I was saying\nHer look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began\nanew:\nAs I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had sud-\ndenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had\nnot been dif\u0002cult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could\ntrace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a\nprivilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to\nspeak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege\nof \u0002lling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion\nof a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king,\nthe queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in\nvain;then the history of your father would have been the history of\nthis unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.\nI entreat you to tell me more, sir.\nI will. I am going to. You can bear it?\nI can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this\nmoment.\nYou speak collectedly, and youare collected. That's good!\n(Though his manner was less satis\u0002ed than his words.) A matter of\nbusiness. Regard it as a matter of business-business that must be done.\nNow if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had\nsuffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born\nThe little child was a daughter, sir.\nA daughter. A-a-matter of businessdon't be distressed. Miss, if\nthe poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,\nthat she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheri-\ntance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing\nher in the belief that her father was deadNo, don't kneel! In Heaven's\nname why should you kneel to me!\nFor the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!\nA-a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact\nbusiness if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly\nmention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many\nshillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so\nmuch more at my ease about your state of mind.\nWithout directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he\nhad very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp\nhis wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she com-\nmunicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\nThat's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business\nbefore you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course\nwith you. And when she diedI believe broken-heartedhaving never\nslackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two\nyears old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the\ndark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon\nwore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering\nyears.\nAs he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the\n\u0003owing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been\nalready tinged with grey.\nYou know that your parents had no great possession, and that what\nthey had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no\nnew discovery, of money, or of any other property; but\nHe felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the\nforehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was\nnow immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.\nBut he has beenbeen found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is\ntoo probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the\nbest. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old\nservant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you,\nto restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\nA shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said,\nin a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,\nI am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghostnot him!\nMr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. There, there,\nthere! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you,\nnow. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and,\nwith a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his\ndear side.\nShe repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, I have been free,\nI have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!\nOnly one thing more, said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a\nwholesome means of enforcing her attention: he has been found under\nanother name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be\nworse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to\nknow whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly\nheld prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,\nbecause it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, any-\nwhere or in any way, and to remove himfor a while at all eventsout\nof France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important\nas they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry\nabout me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret\nservice altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all com-\nprehended in the one line, `Recalled to Life;' which may mean anything.\nBut what is the matter! She doesn't notice a word! Miss Manette!\nPerfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she\nsat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and \u0002xed\nupon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved\nor branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that\nhe feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called\nout loudly for assistance without moving.\nA wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry ob-\nserved to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed\nin some extraordinary tight-\u0002tting fashion, and to have on her head a\nmost wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good\nmeasure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in\nadvance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detach-\nment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest,\nand sending him \u0003ying back against the nearest wall.\n(I really think this must be a man! was Mr. Lorry's breathless\nre\u0003ection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)\nWhy, look at you all! bawled this \u0002gure, addressing the inn ser-\nvants. Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there\nstaring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go\nand fetch things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts,\ncold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.\nThere was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she\nsoftly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and\ngentleness: calling her my precious! and my bird! and spreading\nher golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.\nAnd you in brown! she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;\ncouldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her\nto death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do\nyou call that being a Banker?\nMr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to\nanswer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler\nsympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the\ninn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know some-\nthing not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge\nby a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping\nhead upon her shoulder.\nI hope she will do well now, said Mr. Lorry.\nNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\nI hope, said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and\nhumility, that you accompany Miss Manette to France?\nA likely thing, too! replied the strong woman. If it was ever\nintended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence\nwould have cast my lot in an island?\nThis being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry with-\ndrew to consider it.", "index": 3}
{"sub_book_number": "First", "sub_book_title": "Recalled to Life", "chapter_number": 5, "chapter_title": "The Wine-shop", "chapter_text": "A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The\naccident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\nout with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside\nthe door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\nAll the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\nidleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular\nstones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\nthought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\nhad dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\njostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,\nmade scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\nwomen, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\nrun out between their \u0002ngers. Others, men and women, dipped in the\npuddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with hand-\nkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'\nmouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it\nran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here\nand there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new di-\nrections; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of\nthe cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments\nwith eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and\nnot only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along\nwith it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody\nacquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.\nA shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men,\nwomen, and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game\nlasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.\nThere was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on\nthe part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially\namong the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking\nof healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a\ndozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had\nbeen most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by \u0002ngers, these\ndemonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man\nwho had left his saw sticking in the \u0002rewood he was cutting, set it in\nmotion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\nhot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\nstarved \u0002ngers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\nwith bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged\ninto the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and\na gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than\nsunshine.\nThe wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow\nstreet in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It\nhad stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet,\nand many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood,\nleft red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed\nher baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her\nhead again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask,\nhad acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so\nbesmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than\nin it, scrawled upon a wall with his \u0002nger dipped in muddy wine-lees\nblood.\nThe time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\nstreet-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\nAnd now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momen-\ntary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it\nwas heavy-cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\nwaiting on the saintly presence-nobles of great power all of them; but,\nmost especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terri-\nble grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous\nmill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in\nand out at every doorway, looked from every window, \u0003uttered in every\nvestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked\nthem down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had\nancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown\nfaces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\nwas the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed\nout of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles\nand lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood\nand paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small mod-\nicum of \u0002rewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the\nsmokeless chimneys, and started up from the \u0002lthy street that had no\noffal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription\non the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock\nof bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\nwas offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\nchestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\nfarthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\ndrops of oil.\nIts abiding place was in all things \u0002tted to it. A narrow winding\nstreet, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\ndiverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\nand nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\nthat looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\nwild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\nslinking though they were, eyes of \u0002re were not wanting among them;\nnor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads\nknitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about endur-\ning, or in\u0003icting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the\nshops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the pork-\nman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest\nof meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-\nshops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and\nwere gloweringly con\u0002dential together. Nothing was represented in a\n\u0003ourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives\nand axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and\nthe gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pave-\nment, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no foot-\nways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends,\nran down the middle of the streetwhen it ran at all: which was only af-\nter heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric \u0002ts, into the houses.\nAcross the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a\nrope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and\nlighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a\nsickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea,\nand the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\nFor, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\nshould have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\nlong, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\nup men by those ropes and pulleys, to \u0003are upon the darkness of their\ncondition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew\nover France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, \u0002ne\nof song and feather, took no warning.\nThe wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its ap-\npearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\nit, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\nfor the lost wine. It's not my affair, said he, with a \u0002nal shrug of\nthe shoulders. The people from the market did it. Let them bring\nanother.\nThere, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\nhe called to him across the way:\nSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\nThe fellow pointed to his joke with immense signi\u0002cance, as is often\nthe way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\noften the way with his tribe too.\nWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital? said the wine-\nshop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful\nof mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. Why do you\nwrite in the public streets? Is theretell me thouis there no other\nplace to write such words in?\nIn his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps acciden-\ntally, perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with\nhis own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic\ndancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into\nhis hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wol\u0002shly\npractical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\nPut it on, put it on, said the other. Call wine, wine; and \u0002nish\nthere. With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's\ndress, such as it wasquite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\nhis account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\nThis wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of\nthirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it\nwas a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\nHis shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\nthe elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his\nown crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with\ngood eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured\nlooking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of\na strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met,\nrushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing\nwould turn the man.\nMadame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\ncame in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age,\nwith a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large\nhand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure\nof manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which\none might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against\nherself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame De-\nfarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity\nof bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment\nof her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid\nit down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her\nright elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing\nwhen her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in\ncombination with the lifting of her darkly de\u0002ned eyebrows over her\ntoothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he\nwould do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any\nnew customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.\nThe wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they\nrested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in\na corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\ndominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\nof wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly\ngentleman said in a look to the young lady, This is our man.\nWhat the devil do you do in that galley there? said Monsieur\nDefarge to himself; I don't know you.\nBut, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into dis-\ncourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the\ncounter.\nHow goes it, Jacques? said one of these three to Monsieur De-\nfarge. Is all the spilt wine swallowed?\nEvery drop, Jacques, answered Monsieur Defarge.\nWhen this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame De-\nfarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of\ncough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\nIt is not often, said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\nDefarge, that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine,\nor of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?\nIt is so, Jacques, Monsieur Defarge returned.\nAt this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge,\nstill using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another\ngrain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\nThe last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\ndrinking vessel and smacked his lips.\nAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\nalways have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\nright, Jacques?\nYou are right, Jacques, was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\nThis third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the\nmoment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eye-\nbrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.\nHold then! True! muttered her husband. Gentlemenmy wife!\nThe three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with\nthree \u0003ourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head,\nand giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner\nround the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness\nand repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.\nGentlemen, said her husband, who had kept his bright eye obser-\nvantly upon her, good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion,\nthat you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on\nthe \u0002fth \u0003oor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\nclose to the left here, pointing with his hand, near to the window of\nmy establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already\nbeen there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!\nThey paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\nDefarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentle-\nman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\nWillingly, sir, said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with\nhim to the door.\nTheir conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the \u0002rst\nword, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not\nlasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\nbeckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\nknitted with nimble \u0002ngers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\nMr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop\nthus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed\nhis own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black\ncourtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses,\ninhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry\nto the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one\nknee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a\ngentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transforma-\ntion had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in\nhis face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry,\ndangerous man.\nIt is very high; it is a little dif\u0002cult. Better to begin slowly. Thus,\nMonsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascend-\ning the stairs.\nIs he alone? the latter whispered.\nAlone! God help him, who should be with him! said the other, in\nthe same low voice.\nIs he always alone, then?\nYes.\nOf his own desire?\nOf his own necessity. As he was, when I \u0002rst saw him after they\nfound me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril\nbe discreetas he was then, so he is now.\nHe is greatly changed?\nChanged!\nThe keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\nand mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half\nso forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\ntwo companions ascended higher and higher.\nSuch a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\nparts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\nindeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\nwithin the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say, the room\nor rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft\nits own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides \u0003inging other refuse\nfrom its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decom-\nposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and\ndeprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two\nbad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such\nan atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.\nYielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion's\nagitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice\nstopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating,\nby which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed\nto escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through\nthe rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled\nneighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the\nsummits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it\nof healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\nAt last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\nthird time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\nand of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\nwas reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in ad-\nvance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though\nhe dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself\nabout here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried\nover his shoulder, took out a key.\nThe door is locked then, my friend? said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\nAy. Yes, was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\nYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so re-\ntired?\nI think it necessary to turn the key. Monsieur Defarge whispered\nit closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.\nWhy?\nWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would\nbe frightened-rave-tear himself to pieces-die-come to I know not what\nharmif his door was left open.\nIs it possible! exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\nIs it possible! repeated Defarge, bitterly. Yes. And a beautiful\nworld we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things\nare possible, and not only possible, but donedone, see you!under\nthat sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.\nThis dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a\nword of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she\ntrembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep\nanxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it\nincumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\nCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in\na moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\nall the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring\nto him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's\nwell, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!\nThey went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they\nwere soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came\nall at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close\ntogether at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the\nroom to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in\nthe wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and\nrose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been\ndrinking in the wine-shop.\nI forgot them in the surprise of your visit, explained Monsieur\nDefarge. Leave us, good boys; we have business here.\nThe three glided by, and went silently down.\nThere appearing to be no other door on that \u0003oor, and the keeper of\nthe wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\nLorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\nDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\nI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\nIs that well?\nI think it is well.\nWho are the few? How do you choose them?\nI choose them as real men, of my nameJacques is my nameto\nwhom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is\nanother thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\nWith an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and\nlooked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again,\nhe struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object\nthan to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key\nacross it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and\nturned it as heavily as he could.\nThe door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into\nthe room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little\nmore than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\nHe looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr.\nLorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for\nhe felt that she was sinking.\nA-a-a-business, business! he urged, with a moisture that was not\nof business shining on his cheek. Come in, come in!\nI am afraid of it, she answered, shuddering.\nOf it? What?\nI mean of him. Of my father.\nRendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning\nof their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\nshoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\ndown just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\nDefarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\ntook out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, me-\nthodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\ncould make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread\nto where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\nThe garret, built to be a depository for \u0002rewood and the like, was\ndim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door\nin the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\nthe street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\nother door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of\nthis door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little\nway. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means,\nthat it was dif\u0002cult, on \u0002rst coming in, to see anything; and long habit\nalone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\nrequiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\ndone in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\ntowards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking\nat him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and\nvery busy, making shoes.", "index": 4}
{"sub_book_number": "First", "sub_book_title": "Recalled to Life", "chapter_number": 6, "chapter_title": "The Shoemaker", "chapter_text": "Good day! said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head\nthat bent low over the shoemaking.\nIt was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\nsalutation, as if it were at a distance:\nGood day!\nYou are still hard at work, I see?\nAfter a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and\nthe voice replied, YesI am working. This time, a pair of haggard\neyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\nThe faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\nfaintness of physical weakness, though con\u0002nement and hard fare no\ndoubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\nthe faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of\na sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\nresonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\nbeautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\nsuppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it\nwas, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied\nout by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home\nand friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\nSome minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had\nlooked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull\nmechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor\nthey were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\nI want, said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoe-\nmaker, to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?\nThe shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listen-\ning, at the \u0003oor on one side of him; then similarly, at the \u0003oor on the\nother side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\nWhat did you say?\nYou can bear a little more light?\nI must bear it, if you let it in. (Laying the palest shadow of a stress\nupon the second word.)\nThe opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at\nthat angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\nshowed the workman with an un\u0002nished shoe upon his lap, pausing in\nhis labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at\nhis feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not\nvery long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness\nand thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under\nhis yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had\nbeen really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnat-\nurally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed\nhis body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and\nhis loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long\nseclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull unifor-\nmity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which\nwas which.\nHe had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very\nbones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\npausing in his work. He never looked at the \u0002gure before him, without\n\u0002rst looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost\nthe habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without \u0002rst\nwandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\nAre you going to \u0002nish that pair of shoes to-day? asked Defarge,\nmotioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\nWhat did you say?\nDo you mean to \u0002nish that pair of shoes to-day?\nI can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know.\nBut, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it\nagain.\nMr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door.\nWhen he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the\nshoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another \u0002gure,\nbut the unsteady \u0002ngers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he\nlooked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour),\nand then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the\nshoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.\nYou have a visitor, you see, said Monsieur Defarge.\nWhat did you say?\nHere is a visitor.\nThe shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand\nfrom his work.\nCome! said Defarge. Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made\nshoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take\nit, monsieur.\nMr. Lorry took it in his hand.\nTell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.\nThere was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\nI forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?\nI said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's infor-\nmation?\nIt is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the\npresent mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.\nHe glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\nAnd the maker's name? said Defarge.\nNow that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right\nhand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand\nin the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded\nchin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission.\nThe task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank\nwhen he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from\na swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the\nspirit of a fast-dying man.\nDid you ask me for my name?\nAssuredly I did.\nOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\nIs that all?\nOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\nWith a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to\nwork again, until the silence was again broken.\nYou are not a shoemaker by trade? said Mr. Lorry, looking stead-\nfastly at him.\nHis haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred\nthe question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned\nback on the questioner when they had sought the ground.\nI am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by\ntrade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to\nHe lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes\non his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the\nface from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started,\nand resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting\nto a subject of last night.\nI asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much dif\u0002culty after\na long while, and I have made shoes ever since.\nAs he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him,\nMr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:\nMonsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?\nThe shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking \u0002xedly at the\nquestioner.\nMonsieur Manette; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm;\ndo you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is\nthere no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising\nin your mind, Monsieur Manette?\nAs the captive of many years sat looking \u0002xedly, by turns, at Mr.\nLorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent\nintelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves\nthrough the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded\nagain, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And\nso exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her\nwho had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and\nwhere she now stood looking at him, with hands which at \u0002rst had been\nonly raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and\nshut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,\ntrembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young\nbreast, and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression\nrepeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it\nlooked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.\nDarkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two,\nless and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the\nground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long\nsigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.\nHave you recognised him, monsieur? asked Defarge in a whisper.\nYes; for a moment. At \u0002rst I thought it quite hopeless, but I have\nunquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so\nwell. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!\nShe had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on\nwhich he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the\n\u0002gure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped\nover his labour.\nNot a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a\nspirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.\nIt happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument\nin his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him which\nwas not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\nstooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He\nraised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but\nshe stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his\nstriking at her with the knife, though they had.\nHe stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\nto form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By de-\ngrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard\nto say:\nWhat is this?\nWith the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to\nher lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if\nshe laid his ruined head there.\nYou are not the gaoler's daughter?\nShe sighed No.\nWho are you?\nNot yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench\nbeside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange\nthrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he\nlaid the knife down' softly, as he sat staring at her.\nHer golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly\npushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little\nand little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he\nwent astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.\nBut not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his\nshoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be\nsure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his\nneck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached\nto it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little\nquantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he\nhad, in some old day, wound off upon his \u0002nger.\nHe took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. It is\nthe same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!\nAs the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed\nto become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the\nlight, and looked at her.\nShe had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was\nsummoned outshe had a fear of my going, though I had noneand\nwhen I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my\nsleeve. 'You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in\nthe body, though they may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I\nremember them very well.\nHe formed this speech with his lips many times before he could ut-\nter it. But when he did \u0002nd spoken words for it, they came to him\ncoherently, though slowly.\nHow was this?was it you?\nOnce more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with\na frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only\nsaid, in a low voice, I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near\nus, do not speak, do not move!\nHark! he exclaimed. Whose voice was that?\nHis hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his\nwhite hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but\nhis shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and\ntried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily\nshook his head.\nNo, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what\nthe prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face\nshe knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She wasand\nHe wasbefore the slow years of the North Towerages ago. What is\nyour name, my gentle angel?\nHailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her\nknees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\nO, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my\nmother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard\nhistory. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All\nthat I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and\nto bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!\nHis cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed\nand lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.\nIf you hear in my voiceI don't know that it is so, but I hope it is\nif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet\nmusic in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching\nmy hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast\nwhen you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint\nto you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all\nmy duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance\nof a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for\nit, weep for it!\nShe held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast\nlike a child.\nIf, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I\nhave come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at\npeace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and\nof our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if,\nwhen I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of\nmy mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured\nfather, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all\nday and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor\nmother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her,\nthen, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears\nupon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God\nfor us, thank God!\nHe had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a\nsight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering\nwhich had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.\nWhen the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his\nheaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that\nmust follow all stormsemblem to humanity, of the rest and silence\ninto which the storm called Life must hush at lastthey came forward\nto raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually\ndropped to the \u0003oor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had\nnestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her\nhair drooping over him curtained him from the light.\nIf, without disturbing him, she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry\nas he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, all could\nbe arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the, very door,\nhe could be taken away\nBut, consider. Is he \u0002t for the journey? asked Mr. Lorry.\nMore \u0002t for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to\nhim.\nIt is true, said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.\nMore than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of\nFrance. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?\nThat's business, said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice\nhis methodical manners; and if business is to be done, I had better do\nit.\nThen be so kind, urged Miss Manette, as to leave us here. You\nsee how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave\nhim with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to\nsecure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will \u0002nd him, when\nyou come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care\nof him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.\nBoth Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course,\nand in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only\ncarriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time\npressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily\ndividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away\nto do it.\nThen, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down\non the hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The\ndarkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light\ngleamed through the chinks in the wall.\nMr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the jour-\nney, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrap-\npers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this\nprovender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there\nwas nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry\nroused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.\nNo human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind,\nin the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had\nhappened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether\nhe knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have\nsolved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very\nslow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed\nfor the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost man-\nner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been\nseen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his\ndaughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.\nIn the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coer-\ncion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on\nthe cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily\nresponded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took\nand kepther hand in both his own.\nThey began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going \u0002rst with the lamp,\nMr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many\nsteps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof\nand round at the wails.\nYou remember the place, my father? You remember coming up\nhere?\nWhat did you say?\nBut, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer\nas if she had repeated it.\nRemember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago.\nThat he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought\nfrom his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him\nmutter, One Hundred and Five, North Tower; and when he looked\nabout him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long\nencompassed him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively al-\ntered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there\nwas no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street,\nhe dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.\nNo crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of\nthe many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An\nunnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be\nseen, and that was Madame Defargewho leaned against the door-post,\nknitting, and saw nothing.\nThe prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed\nhim, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking, mis-\nerably, for his shoemaking tools and the un\u0002nished shoes. Madame De-\nfarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and\nwent, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly\nbrought them down and handed them in;and immediately afterwards\nleaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\nDefarge got upon the box, and gave the word To the Barrier! The\npostilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble\nover-swinging lamps.\nUnder the over-swinging lampsswinging ever brighter in the bet-\nter streets, and ever dimmer in the worseand by lighted shops, gay\ncrowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city\ngates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. Your papers,\ntravellers! See here then, Monsieur the Of\u0002cer, said Defarge, getting\ndown, and taking him gravely apart, these are the papers of monsieur\ninside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at\nthe He dropped his voice, there was a \u0003utter among the military\nlanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in\nuniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or\nan every night look, at monsieur with the white head. It is well. For-\nward! from the uniform. Adieu! from Defarge. And so, under a\nshort grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the\ngreat grove of stars.\nBeneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote\nfrom this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their\nrays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything\nis suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.\nAll through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more\nwhispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorrysitting opposite the buried\nman who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were\nfor ever lost to him, and what were capable of restorationthe old\ninquiry:\nI hope you care to be recalled to life?\nAnd the old answer:\nI can't say.", "index": 5}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 1, "chapter_title": "Five Years Later", "chapter_text": "Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the\nyear one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very\ndark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,\nmoreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were\nproud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,\nproud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its em-\ninence in those particulars, and were \u0002red by an express conviction\nthat, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This\nwas no passive belief, but an active weapon which they \u0003ashed at more\nconvenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-\nroom, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment.\nNoakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank\nHeaven!\nAny one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the\nquestion of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much\non a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for\nsuggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly\nobjectionable, but were only the more respectable.\nThus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfec-\ntion of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy\nwith a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,\nand came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little coun-\nters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind\nrustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows,\nwhich were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and\nwhich were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the\nheavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing\nthe House, you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the\nback, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came\nwith its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the\ndismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old\nwooden drawers, particles of which \u0003ew up your nose and down your\nthroat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty\nodour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was\nstowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communica-\ntions corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into\nextemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted\nall the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your\nlighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room,\nthat always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and\nwhere, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the \u0002rst\nletters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were\nbut newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows,\nby the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and fe-\nrocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.\nBut indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue\nwith all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's. Death\nis Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? Accord-\ningly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to\nDeath; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner\nof forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse\nat Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner\nof a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the\nnotes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it\ndid the least good in the way of preventionit might almost have been\nworth remarking that the fact was exactly the reversebut, it cleared\noff (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left noth-\ning else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day,\nlike greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many\nlives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple\nBar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have\nexcluded what little light the ground \u0003oor had, in a rather signi\u0002cant\nmanner.\nCramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson's,\nthe oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a\nyoung man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till\nhe was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had\nthe full Tellson \u0003avour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he\npermitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting\nhis breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.\nOutside Tellson'snever by any means in it, unless called inwas\nan odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as\nthe live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours,\nunless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly\nurchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that\nTellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had\nalways tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had\ndrifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the\nyouthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness,\nin the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added\nappellation of Jerry.\nThe scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-\nalley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy\nMarch morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr.\nCruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Domi-\nnoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from\nthe invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name\nupon it.)\nMr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood,\nand were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass\nin it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early\nas it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed\nwas already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers\narranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white\ncloth was spread.\nMr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a\nHarlequin at home. At fast, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began\nto roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky\nhair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture,\nhe exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:\nBust me, if she ain't at it agin!\nA woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees\nin a corner, with suf\u0002cient haste and trepidation to show that she was\nthe person referred to.\nWhat! said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. You're\nat it agin, are you?\nAfter hailing the mom with this second salutation, he threw a boot\nat the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce\nthe odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy,\nthat, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots,\nhe often got up next morning to \u0002nd the same boots covered with clay.\nWhat, said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his\nmarkwhat are you up to, Aggerawayter?\nI was only saying my prayers.\nSaying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by\n\u0003opping yourself down and praying agin me?\nI was not praying against you; I was praying for you.\nYou weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with.\nHere! your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin\nyour father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.\nYou've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and \u0003opping\nherself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched\nout of the mouth of her only child.\nMaster Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turn-\ning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal\nboard.\nAnd what do you suppose, you conceited female, said Mr.\nCruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, that the worth of your\nprayers may be? Name the price that you put your prayers at!\nThey only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more\nthan that.\nWorth no more than that, repeated Mr. Cruncher. They ain't\nworth much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I\ncan't afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking.\nIf you must go \u0003opping yourself down, \u0003op in favour of your husband\nand child, and not in opposition to 'em. If I had had any but a unnat'ral\nwife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might\nhave made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and\ncountermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-u-\nu-ust me! said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his\nclothes, if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and another,\nbeen choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a\nhonest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and\nwhile I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and\nif you see any signs of more \u0003opping, give me a call. For, I tell you,\nhere he addressed his wife once more, I won't be gone agin, in this\nmanner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as laudanum,\nmy lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if it wasn't\nfor the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I'm\nnone the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've been\nat it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in\npocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say\nnow!\nGrowling, in addition, such phrases as Ah! yes! You're religious,\ntoo. You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your\nhusband and child, would you? Not you! and throwing off other\nsarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr.\nCruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general prepara-\ntion for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished\nwith tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another,\nas his father's did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly\ndisturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping\ncloset, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of You are go-\ning to \u0003op, mother. Halloa, father! and, after raising this \u0002ctitious\nalarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.\nMr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to\nhis breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular\nanimosity.\nNow, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?\nHis wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing.\nDon't do it! said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather ex-\npected to see the loaf disappear under the ef\u0002cacy of his wife's petitions.\nI ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my\nwittles blest off my table. Keep still!\nExceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a\nparty which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher\nworried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-\nfooted inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his\nruf\u0003ed aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exte-\nrior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupa-\ntion of the day.\nIt could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description\nof himself as a honest tradesman. His stock consisted of a wooden\nstool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young\nJerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the\nbanking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the\naddition of the \u0002rst handful of straw that could be gleaned from any\npassing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it\nformed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher\nwas as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,and\nwas almost as in-looking.\nEncamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-\ncornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's, Jerry\ntook up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry\nstanding by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar,\nto in\u0003ict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing\nboys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,\nextremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traf\u0002c in\nFleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes\nof each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.\nThe resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that\nthe mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the\nyouthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in\nFleet-street.\nThe head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tell-\nson's establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:\nPorter wanted!\nHooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!\nHaving thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself\non the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father\nhad been chewing, and cogitated.\nAl-ways rusty! His \u0002ngers is al-ways rusty! muttered young Jerry.\nWhere does my father get all that iron rust from? He don't get no iron\nrust here!", "index": 6}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 2, "chapter_title": "A Sight", "chapter_text": "You know the Old Bailey, well, no doubt? said one of the oldest of\nclerks to Jerry the messenger.\nYe-es, sir, returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. I do\nknow the Bailey.\nJust so. And you know Mr. Lorry.\nI know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much\nbetter, said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in\nquestion, than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.\nVery well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the\ndoor-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.\nInto the court, sir?\nInto the court.\nMr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and\nto interchange the inquiry, What do you think of this?\nAm I to wait in the court, sir? he asked, as the result of that\nconference.\nI am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.\nLorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's atten-\ntion, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to\nremain there until he wants you.\nIs that all, sir?\nThat's all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell\nhim you are there.\nAs the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,\nMr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the\nblotting-paper stage, remarked:\nI suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?\nTreason!\nThat's quartering, said Jerry. Barbarous!\nIt is the law, remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised\nspectacles upon him. It is the law.\nIt's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. Ifs hard enough to kill\nhim, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir.\nNot at all, retained the ancient clerk. Speak well of the law. Take\ncare of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take\ncare of itself. I give you that advice.\nIt's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice, said Jerry.\nI leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.\nWell, well, said the old clerk; we all have our various ways of\ngaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have\ndry ways. Here is the letter. Go along.\nJerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal\ndeference than he made an outward show of, You are a lean old one,\ntoo, made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and\nwent his way.\nThey hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate\nhad not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.\nBut, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and\nvillainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came\ninto court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the\ndock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.\nIt had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pro-\nnounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died\nbefore him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly\ninn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and\ncoaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two\nmiles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citi-\nzens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the\nbeginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution,\nthat in\u0003icted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent;\nalso, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very human-\nising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions\nin blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically\nleading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed\nunder Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\nillustration of the precept, that Whatever is is right; an aphorism that\nwould be as \u0002nal as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome conse-\nquence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\nMaking his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down\nthis hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to\nmake his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and\nhanded in his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see\nthe play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam\nonly the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the\nOld Bailey doors were well guardedexcept, indeed, the social doors\nby which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.\nAfter some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its\nhinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze\nhimself into court.\nWhat's on? he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself\nnext to.\nNothing yet.\nWhat's coming on?\nThe Treason case.\nThe quartering one, eh?\nAh! returned the man, with a relish; he'll be drawn on a hurdle\nto be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his\nown face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks\non, and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.\nThat's the sentence.\nIf he's found Guilty, you mean to say? Jerry added, by way of\nproviso.\nOh! they'll \u0002nd him guilty, said the other. Don't you be afraid\nof that.\nMr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper,\nwhom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand.\nMr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from\na wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of\npapers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with\nhis hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher\nlooked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceil-\ning of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and\nsigning with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had\nstood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.\nWhat's he got to do with the case? asked the man he had spoken\nwith.\nBlest if I know, said Jerry.\nWhat have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?\nBlest if I know that either, said Jerry.\nThe entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling\ndown in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became\nthe central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,\nwont out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.\nEverybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at\nthe ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at\nhim, like a sea, or a wind, or a \u0002re. Eager faces strained round pillars\nand corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up,\nnot to miss a hair of him; people on the \u0003oor of the court, laid their\nhands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves,\nat anybody's cost, to a view of himstood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges,\nstood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous\namong these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate,\nJerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had\ntaken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves\nof other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that \u0003owed\nat him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an\nimpure mist and rain.\nThe object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about\n\u0002ve-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek\nand a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He\nwas plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was\nlong and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more\nto be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind\nwill express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness\nwhich his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek,\nshowing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite\nself-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.\nThe sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed\nat, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a\nless horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage\ndetails being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his fasci-\nnation. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,\nwas the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and\ntorn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various specta-\ntors put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of\nself-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.\nSilence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not\nGuilty to an indictment denouncing him (with in\u0002nite jingle and jangle)\nfor that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and\nso forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers\noccasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French\nKing, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so\nforth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions\nof our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the\nsaid French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise\nevil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our\nsaid serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to\nsend to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head\nbecoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out\nwith huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding\nthat the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay,\nstood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in;\nand that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.\nThe accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally\nhanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither \u0003inched\nfrom the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet\nand attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;\nand stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so\ncomposedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which\nit was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with\nvinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.\nOver the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down\nupon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been re\u0003ected\nin it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted\nin a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if\nthe glass could ever have rendered back its re\u0003ections, as the ocean is\none day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and\ndisgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's\nmind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious\nof a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass\nhis face \u0003ushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.\nIt happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court\nwhich was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that\ncorner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immedi-\nately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect,\nthat all the eyes that were tamed upon him, turned to them.\nThe spectators saw in the two \u0002gures, a young lady of little more\nthan twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a\nvery remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his\nhair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,\nbut pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon\nhim, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken\nupas it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughterhe\nbecame a handsome man, not past the prime of life.\nHis daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she\nsat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him,\nin her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead\nhad been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion\nthat saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very\nnoticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who\nhad had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went\nabout, Who are they?\nJerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his\nown manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his \u0002ngers in his\nabsorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about\nhim had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and\nfrom him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got\nto Jerry:\nWitnesses.\nFor which side?\nAgainst.\nAgainst what side?\nThe prisoner's.\nThe Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled\nthem, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life\nwas in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind\nthe axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.", "index": 7}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 3, "chapter_title": "A Disappointment", "chapter_text": "Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before\nthem, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which\nclaimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public\nenemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of\nlast year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had,\nfor longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between\nFrance and England, on secret business of which he could give no hon-\nest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive\n(which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his busi-\nness might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had\nput it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond re-\nproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes, and, struck\nwith horror, to disclose them to his Majesty's Chief Secretary of State\nand most honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be pro-\nduced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole,\nsublime. That, he had been the prisoner's friend, but, at once in an aus-\npicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate\nthe traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar\nof his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient\nGreece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would as-\nsuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed, he probably\nwould not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in\nmany passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word,\nat the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury's countenances displayed\na guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was\nin a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as pa-\ntriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate\nand unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however\nunworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner's ser-\nvant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his\nmaster's table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr.\nAttorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted\nof this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him\nto his (Mr. Attorney-General's) brothers and sisters, and honoured him\nmore than his (Mr. Attorney-General's) father and mother. That, he\ncalled with con\u0002dence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the\nevidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their\ndiscovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have\nbeen furnished with lists of his Majesty's forces, and of their disposi-\ntion and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt\nthat he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.\nThat, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting;\nbut that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for\nthe prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.\nThat, the proof would go back \u0002ve years, and would show the prisoner\nalready engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before\nthe date of the very \u0002rst action fought between the British troops and\nthe Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as\nhe knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they\nwere), must positively \u0002nd the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him,\nwhether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon\ntheir pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives lay-\ning their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the\nnotion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short,\nthat there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads\nupon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. That head\nMr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of\neverything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of\nhis solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good\nas dead and gone.\nWhen the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if\na cloud of great blue-\u0003ies were swarming about the prisoner, in antici-\npation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the\nunimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.\nMr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the\npatriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul\nwas exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to beperhaps,\nif it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom\nof its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the\nwigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.\nLorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting\nopposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.\nHad he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinua-\ntion. What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property?\nHe didn't precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business\nof anybody's. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Dis-\ntant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly\nnot. Never in a debtors' prison? Didn't see what that had to do with\nit. Never in a debtors' prison?Come, once again. Never? Yes. How\nmany times? Two or three times. Not \u0002ve or six? Perhaps. Of what pro-\nfession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently?\nNo. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on\nthe top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. Kicked\non that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said\nby the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.\nSwear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never.\nEver live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow\nmoney of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy\nwith the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner\nin coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these\nlists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured\nthem himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence?\nNo. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh\ndear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no. Swear that? Over and over\nagain. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.\nThe virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at\na great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and\nsimplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais\npacket, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.\nHe had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of\ncharitynever thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions\nof the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In ar-\nranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these\nin the prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists\nfrom the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there\n\u0002rst. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gen-\ntlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais\nand Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given\ninformation. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;\nhe had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be\nonly a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;\nthat was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious\ncoincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a\ncurious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He\nwas a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.\nThe blue-\u0003ies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr.\nJarvis Lorry.\nMr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?\nI am.\nOn a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hun-\ndred and seventy-\u0002ve, did business occasion you to travel between Lon-\ndon and Dover by the mail?\nIt did.\nWere there any other passengers in the mail?\nTwo.\nDid they alight on the road in the course of the night?\nThey did.\nMr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passen-\ngers?\nI cannot undertake to say that he was.\nDoes he resemble either of these two passengers?\nBoth were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were\nall so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.\nMr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped\nup as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and\nstature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?\nNo.\nYou will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?\nNo.\nSo at least you say he may have been one of them?\nYes. Except that I remember them both to have beenlike myself\ntimorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.\nDid you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?\nI certainly have seen that.\nMr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him,\nto your certain knowledge, before?\nI have.\nWhen?\nI was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais,\nthe prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and\nmade the voyage with me.\nAt what hour did he come on board?\nAt a little after midnight.\nIn the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on\nboard at that untimely hour?\nHe happened to be the only one.\nNever mind about `happening,' Mr. Lorry. He was the only passen-\nger who came on board in the dead of the night?\nHe was.\nWere you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?\nWith two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.\nThey are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?\nHardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and\nrough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.\nMiss Manette!\nThe young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were\nnow turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her,\nand kept her hand drawn through his arm.\nMiss Manette, look upon the prisoner.\nTo be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty,\nwas far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the\ncrowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not\nall the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve\nhim to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs\nbefore him into imaginary beds of \u0003owers in a garden; and his efforts to\ncontrol and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour\nrushed to his heart. The buzz of the great \u0003ies was loud again.\nMiss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?\nYes, sir.\nWhere?\nOn board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the\nsame occasion.\nYou are the young lady just now referred to?\nO! most unhappily, I am!\nThe plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical\nvoice of the Judge, as he said something \u0002ercely: Answer the questions\nput to you, and make no remark upon them.\nMiss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that\npassage across the Channel?\nYes, sir.\nRecall it.\nIn the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: When the\ngentleman came on board\nDo you mean the prisoner? inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.\nYes, my Lord.\nThen say the prisoner.\nWhen the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father, turn-\ning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, was much fatigued\nand in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was\nafraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the\ndeck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of\nhim. There were no other passengers that night, but we four. The pris-\noner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter\nmy father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I had not\nknown how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set\nwhen we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed great\ngentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he felt it.\nThat was the manner of our beginning to speak together.\nLet me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?\nNo.\nHow many were with him?\nTwo French gentlemen.\nHad they conferred together?\nThey had conferred together until the last moment, when it was\nnecessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.\nHad any papers been handed about among them, similar to these\nlists?\nSome papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know\nwhat papers.\nLike these in shape and size?\nPossibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering\nvery near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have\nthe light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and\nthey spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only\nthat they looked at papers.\nNow, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette.\nThe prisoner was as open in his con\u0002dence with mewhich arose\nout of my helpless situationas he was kind, and good, and useful to\nmy father. I hope, bursting into tears, I may not repay him by doing\nhim harm to-day.\nBuzzing from the blue-\u0003ies.\nMiss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that\nyou give the evidence which it is your duty to givewhich you must\ngiveand which you cannot escape from givingwith great unwilling-\nness, he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.\nHe told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and\ndif\u0002cult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was\ntherefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business\nhad, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,\ntake him backwards and forwards between France and England for a\nlong time to come.\nDid he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.\nHe tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he\nsaid that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one\non England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George\nWashington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the\nThird. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said\nlaughingly, and to beguile the time.\nAny strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor\nin a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be\nunconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully\nanxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when\nshe stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon\nthe counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same\nexpression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority\nof the foreheads there, might have been mirrors re\u0003ecting the witness,\nwhen the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous\nheresy about George Washington.\nMr. Attorney-General now signi\u0002ed to my Lord, that he deemed it\nnecessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's\nfather, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.\nDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him\nbefore?\nOnce. When he caged at my lodgings in London. Some three years,\nor three years and a half ago.\nCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet,\nor speak to his conversation with your daughter?\nSir, I can do neither.\nIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to\ndo either?\nHe answered, in a low voice, There is.\nHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, with-\nout trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\nHe answered, in a tone that went to every heart, A long imprison-\nment.\nWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\nThey tell me so.\nHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\nNone. My mind is a blank, from some timeI cannot even say\nwhat timewhen I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes,\nto the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter\nhere. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored\nmy faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become\nfamiliar. I have no remembrance of the process.\nMr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat\ndown together.\nA singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand\nbeing to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter un-\ntracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November \u0002ve years\nago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where\nhe did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles\nor more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information;\na witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time\nrequired, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard\ntown, waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-\nexamining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the\nprisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had\nall this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or\ntwo on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Open-\ning this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great\nattention and curiosity at the prisoner.\nYou say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?\nThe witness was quite sure.\nDid you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?\nNot so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.\nLook well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there, pointing\nto him who had tossed the paper over, and then look well upon the\nprisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?\nAllowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and\nslovenly if not debauched, they were suf\u0002ciently like each other to sur-\nprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus\nbrought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned\nfriend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the like-\nness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver\n(the prisoner's counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name\nof my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord,\nno; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened\nonce, might happen twice; whether he would have been so con\u0002dent if\nhe had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would\nbe so con\u0002dent, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to\nsmash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case\nto useless lumber.\nMr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his\n\u0002ngers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while\nMr. Stryver \u0002tted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit\nof clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy\nand traitor, an unblushing traf\u0002cker in blood, and one of the greatest\nscoundrels upon earth since accursed Judaswhich he certainly did\nlook rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and\npartner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers\nand false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some\nfamily affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his\nmaking those passages across the Channelthough what those affairs\nwere, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, for-\nbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been\nwarped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it\nthey had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent\ngallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman\nand young lady so thrown together;with the exception of that refer-\nence to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and\nimpossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.\nHow it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this\nattempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and\nfears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how,\nnevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous charac-\nter of evidence too often dis\u0002guring such cases, and of which the State\nTrials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as\ngrave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon\nthat Bench and suffer those allusions.\nMr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next\nto attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes\nMr. Stryver had \u0002tted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and\nCly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the\nprisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning\nthe suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole de-\ncidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.\nAnd now, the jury turned to consider, and the great \u0003ies swarmed\nagain.\nMr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,\nchanged neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While\nhis teamed friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whis-\npered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously\nat the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped\nthemselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and\nslowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion\nin the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat\nleaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just\nas it had happened to \u0002ght on his head after its removal, his hands in his\npockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something\nespecially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable\nlook, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to\nthe prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were com-\npared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking\nnote of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought\nthe two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next\nneighbour, and added, I'd hold half a guinea that he don't get no law-\nwork to do. Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?\nYet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he\nappeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon\nher father's breast, he was the \u0002rst to see it, and to say audibly: Of\u0002cer!\nlook to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don't you\nsee she will fall!\nThere was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and\nmuch sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress\nto him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\nstrong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering\nor brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy\ncloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and\npaused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.\nThey were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with\nGeorge Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were\nnot agreed, but signi\u0002ed his pleasure that they should retire under watch\nand ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the\nlamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured\nthat the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to\nget refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and\nsat down.\nMr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father\nwent out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slack-\nened interest, could easily get near him.\nJerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in\nthe way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a\nmoment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the\nbank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple\nBar long before I can.\nJerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in\nacknowedgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came\nup at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.\nHow is the young lady?\nShe is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she\nfeels the better for being out of court.\nI'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentle-\nman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.\nMr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the\npoint in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the\nbar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him,\nall eyes, ears, and spikes.\nMr. Darnay!\nThe prisoner came forward directly.\nYou will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette.\nShe will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.\nI am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her\nso for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?\nYes, I could. I will, if you ask it.\nMr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He\nstood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against\nthe bar.\nI do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.\nWhat, said Carton, still only half turned towards him, do you\nexpect, Mr. Darnay?\nThe worst.\nIt's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their\nwithdrawing is in your favour.\nLoitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no\nmore: but left themso like each other in feature, so unlike each other\nin mannerstanding side by side, both re\u0003ected in the glass above them.\nAn hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal\ncrowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and\nale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking\nthat refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a\nrapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried\nhim along with them.\nJerry! Jerry! Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he\ngot there.\nHere, sir! It's a \u0002ght to get back again. Here I am, sir!\nMr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. Quick! Have\nyou got it?\nYes, sir.\nHastily written on the paper was the word aquitted.\nIf you had sent the message, `Recalled to Life,' again, muttered\nJerry, as he turned, I should have known what you meant, this time.\nHe had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything\nelse, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring\nout with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz\nswept into the street as if the baf\u0003ed blue-\u0003ies were dispersing in search\nof other carrion.", "index": 8}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 4, "chapter_title": "Congratulatory", "chapter_text": "From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the\nhuman stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when\nDoctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor\nfor the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.\nCharles Darnayjust releasedcongratulating him on his escape from\ndeath.\nIt would have been dif\u0002cult by a far brighter light, to recognise in\nDoctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoe-\nmaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice,\nwithout looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had\nnot extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to\nthe abstraction that overclouded him \u0002tfully, without any apparent rea-\nson. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering\nagony, would alwaysas on the trialevoke this condition from the\ndepths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw\na gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his\nstory as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon\nhim by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles\naway.\nOnly his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding\nfrom his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past\nbeyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound\nof her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong\nbene\u0002cial in\u0003uence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for\nshe could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they\nwere few and slight, and she believed them over.\nMr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had\nturned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of\nlittle more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,\nloud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing\nway of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and\nconversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.\nHe still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at\nhis late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry\nclean out of the group: I am glad to have brought you off with honour,\nMr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not\nthe less likely to succeed on that account.\nYou have laid me under an obligation to you for lifein two\nsenses, said his late client, taking his hand.\nI have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good\nas another man's, I believe.\nIt clearly being incumbent on some one to say, Much better, Mr.\nLorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested\nobject of squeezing himself back again.\nYou think so? said Mr. Stryver. Well! you have been present all\nday, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.\nAnd as such, quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the\nlaw had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously\nshouldered him out of itas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to\nbreak up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie\nlooks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\nSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry, said Stryver; I have a night's work\nto do yet. Speak for yourself.\nI speak for myself, answered Mr. Lorry, and for Mr. Darnay, and\nfor Miss Lucie, andMiss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us\nall? He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her\nfather.\nHis face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\nDarnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,\nnot even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his\nthoughts had wandered away.\nMy father, said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\nHe slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.\nShall we go home, my father?\nWith a long breath, he answered Yes.\nThe friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the\nimpressionwhich he himself had originatedthat he would not be\nreleased that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the pas-\nsages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the\ndismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows,\npillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking\nbetween her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open\nair. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed\nin it.\nMr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\nto the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group,\nor interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been lean-\ning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled\nout after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He\nnow stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the\npavement.\nSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\nNobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the\nday's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was\nnone the better for it in appearance.\nIf you knew what a con\u0003ict goes on in the business mind, when the\nbusiness mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\nappearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\nMr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, You have mentioned that\nbefore, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own\nmasters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.\nI know, I know, rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. Don't be nettled,\nMr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare\nsay.\nAnd indeed, sir, pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, I really\ndon't know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as\nvery much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your\nbusiness.\nBusiness! Bless you, I have no business, said Mr. Carton.\nIt is a pity you have not, sir.\nI think so, too.\nIf you had, pursued Mr. Lorry, perhaps you would attend to it.\nLord love you, no!I shouldn't, said Mr. Carton.\nWell, sir! cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\nbusiness is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,\nif business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.\nDarnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make al-\nlowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you,\nsir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy\nlife.Chair there!\nPerhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.\nLorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton,\nwho smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed\nthen, and turned to Darnay:\nThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This\nmust be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counter-\npart on these street stones?\nI hardly seem yet, returned Charles Darnay, to belong to this\nworld again.\nI don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far ad-\nvanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\nI begin to think I am faint.\nThen why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those\nnumskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis,\nor some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\nDrawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill\nto Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\nshown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting\nhis strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\nopposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before\nhim, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\nDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again,\nMr. Darnay?\nI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far\nmended as to feel that.\nIt must be an immense satisfaction!\nHe said it bitterly, and \u0002lled up his glass again: which was a large\none.\nAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.\nIt has no good in it for meexcept wine like thisnor I for it. So we\nare not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not\nmuch alike in any particular, you and I.\nConfused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with\nthis Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay\nwas at a loss how to answer; \u0002nally, answered not at all.\nNow your dinner is done, Carton presently said, why don't you\ncall a health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?\nWhat health? What toast?\nWhy, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll\nswear it's there.\nMiss Manette, then!\nMiss Manette, then!\nLooking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Car-\nton \u0003ung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered\nto pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.\nThat's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Dar-\nnay! he said, ruing his new goblet.\nA slight frown and a laconic Yes, were the answer.\nThat's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does\nit feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such\nsympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\nAgain Darnay answered not a word.\nShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.\nNot that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\nThe allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagree-\nable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of\nthe day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.\nI neither want any thanks, nor merit any, was the careless rejoin-\nder. It was nothing to do, in the \u0002rst place; and I don't know why I did\nit, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\nWillingly, and a small return for your good of\u0002ces.\nDo you think I particularly like you?\nReally, Mr. Carton, returned the other, oddly disconcerted, I\nhave not asked myself the question.\nBut ask yourself the question now.\nYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\nI don't think I do, said Carton. I begin to have a very good\nopinion of your understanding.\nNevertheless, pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, there is\nnothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our\nparting without ill-blood on either side.\nCarton rejoining, Nothing in life! Darnay rang. Do you call the\nwhole reckoning? said Carton. On his answering in the af\u0002rmative,\nThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and\nwake me at ten.\nThe bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.\nWithout returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat\nof de\u0002ance in his manner, and said, A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think\nI am drunk?\nI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\nThink? You know I have been drinking.\nSince I must say so, I know it.\nThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir.\nI care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.\nMuch to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.\nMay be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate\nyou, however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!\nWhen he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to\na glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.\nDo you particularly like the man? he muttered, at his own image;\nwhy should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is\nnothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a\nchange you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man,\nthat he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might\nhave been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked\nat by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face\nas he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the\nfellow.\nHe resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few\nminutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the\ntable, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.", "index": 9}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 5, "chapter_title": "The Jackal", "chapter_text": "Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is\nthe improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moder-\nate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would\nswallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation\nas a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exagger-\nation. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any\nother learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was\nMr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative\npractice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the\ndrier parts of the legal race.\nA favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver\nhad begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on\nwhich he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their\nfavourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself to-\nwards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench,\nthe \u0003orid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out\nof the bed of wigs, like a great sun\u0003ower pushing its way at the sun\nfrom among a rank garden-full of \u0003aring companions.\nIt had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib\nman, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that fac-\nulty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among\nthe most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. But,\na remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more busi-\nness he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith\nand marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney\nCarton, he always had his points at his \u0002ngers' ends in the morning.\nSydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's\ngreat ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and\nMichaelmas, might have \u0003oated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case\nin hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets,\nstaring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even\nthere they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton\nwas rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and un-\nsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get\nabout, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Syd-\nney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal,\nand that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.\nTen o'clock, sir, said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged\nto wake himten o'clock, sir.\nWhat's the matter?\nTen o'clock, sir.\nWhat do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?\nYes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.\nOh! I remember. Very well, very well.\nAfter a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dex-\nterously combated by stirring the \u0002re continuously for \u0002ve minutes, he\ngot up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,\nand, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's\nBench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.\nThe Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone\nhome, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers\non, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease.\nHe had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which\nmay be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries\ndownward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art,\nthrough the portraits of every Drinking Age.\nYou are a little late, Memory, said Stryver.\nAbout the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.\nThey went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with\npapers, where there was a blazing \u0002re. A kettle steamed upon the hob,\nand in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of\nwine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.\nYou have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.\nTwo to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or\nseeing him dineit's all one!\nThat was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the\nidenti\u0002cation. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?\nI thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should\nhave been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.\nMr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.\nYou and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.\nSullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoin-\ning room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a\ntowel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing\nthem out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold,\nsat down at the table, and said, Now I am ready!\nNot much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory, said Mr.\nStryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.\nHow much?\nOnly two sets of them.\nGive me the worst \u0002rst.\nThere they are, Sydney. Fire away!\nThe lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of\nthe drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table\nproper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his\nhand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a\ndifferent way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his\nwaistband, looking at the \u0002re, or occasionally \u0003irting with some lighter\ndocument; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in\nhis task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out\nfor his glasswhich often groped about, for a minute or more, before\nit found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand\nbecame so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up,\nand steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin,\nhe returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can\ndescribe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.\nAt length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion,\nand proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,\nmade his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal\nassisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his\nhands in his waistband again, and lay down to mediate. The jackal then\ninvigorated himself with a bum for his throttle, and a fresh application\nto his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this\nwas administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed\nof until the clocks struck three in the morning.\nAnd now we have done, Sydney, \u0002ll a bumper of punch, said Mr.\nStryver.\nThe jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steam-\ning again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\nYou were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown wit-\nnesses to-day. Every question told.\nI always am sound; am I not?\nI don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some\npunch to it and smooth it again.\nWith a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.\nThe old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School, said Stryver,\nnodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the\npast, the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now\nin spirits and now in despondency!\nAh! returned the other, sighing: yes! The same Sydney, with the\nsame luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my\nown.\nAnd why not?\nGod knows. It was my way, I suppose.\nHe sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before\nhim, looking at the \u0002re.\nCarton, said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,\nas if the \u0002re-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour\nwas forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Car-\nton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, your way\nis, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose.\nLook at me.\nOh, botheration! returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-\nhumoured laugh, don't you be moral!\nHow have I done what I have done? said Stryver; how do I do\nwhat I do?\nPartly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth\nyour while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do,\nyou do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.\nI had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?\nI was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,\nsaid Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\nBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,\npursued Carton, you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into\nmine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of\nParis, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that\nwe didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was\nalways nowhere.\nAnd whose fault was that?\nUpon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always\ndriving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree\nthat I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy\nthing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.\nTurn me in some other direction before I go.\nWell then! Pledge me to the pretty witness, said Stryver, holding\nup his glass. Are you turned in a pleasant direction?\nApparently not, for he became gloomy again.\nPretty witness, he muttered, looking down into his glass. I have\nhad enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty wit-\nness?\nThe picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.\nShe pretty?\nIs she not?\nNo.\nWhy, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!\nRot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey\na judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!\nDo you know, Sydney, said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp\neyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his \u0003orid face: do you know, I\nrather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired\ndoll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?\nQuick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons\nwithin a yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-\nglass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more\ndrink; I'll get to bed.\nWhen his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to\nlight him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its\ngrimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and\nsad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like\na lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\nbefore the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and\nthe \u0002rst spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.\nWaste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood\nstill on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in\nthe wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial,\nand perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries\nfrom which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the\nfruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.\nA moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of\nhouses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its\npillow was wet with wasted tears.\nSadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man\nof good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,\nincapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight\non him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.", "index": 10}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 6, "chapter_title": "Hundreds of People", "chapter_text": "The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not\nfar from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain \u0002ne Sunday when\nthe waves of four months had roiled over the trial for treason, and\ncarried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis\nLorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,\non his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-\nabsorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet\nstreet-corner was the sunny part of his life.\nOn this certain \u0002ne Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early\nin the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on \u0002ne\nSundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;\nsecondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be\nwith them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window,\nand generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to\nhave his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of\nthe Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving\nthem.\nA quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not\nto be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front\nwindows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of\nstreet that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few build-\nings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees \u0003ourished, and\nwild \u0003owers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished\n\u0002elds. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous\nfreedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers with-\nout a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on\nwhich the peaches ripened in their season.\nThe summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part\nof the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,\nthough not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into\na glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful\nplace for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.\nThere ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\nthere was. The Doctor occupied two \u0003oors of a large stiff house, where\nseveral callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was\naudible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\na building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\nrustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\nto be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\nwho had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hallas if\nhe had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of\nall visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\nto live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\na counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\nworkman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\nabout there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\nthump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\nrequired to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the\nhouse, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from\nSunday morning unto Saturday night.\nDoctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation,\nand its revival in the \u0003oating whispers of his story, brought him. His sci-\nenti\u0002c knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious ex-\nperiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned\nas much as he wanted.\nThese things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts,\nand notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the\ncorner, on the \u0002ne Sunday afternoon.\nDoctor Manette at home?\nExpected home.\nMiss Lucie at home?\nExpected home.\nMiss Pross at home?\nPossibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to an-\nticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.\nAs I am at home myself, said Mr. Lorry, I'll go upstairs.\nAlthough the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country\nof her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability\nto make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most\nagreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so\nmany little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its\neffect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from\nthe largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant\nvariety and contrast obtained by thrift in tri\u0003es, by delicate hands, clear\neyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so\nexpressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about\nhim, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of\nthat peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he\napproved?\nThere were three rooms on a \u0003oor, and, the doors by which they\ncommunicated being put open that the air might pass freely through\nthem all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance\nwhich he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The \u0002rst\nwas the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and \u0003owers, and books,\nand desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was\nthe Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,\nchangingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the\nDoctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's\nbench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the \u0002fth \u0003oor of the\ndismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\nI wonder, said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, that he\nkeeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!\nAnd why wonder at that? was the abrupt inquiry that made him\nstart.\nIt proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand,\nwhose acquaintance he had \u0002rst made at the Royal George Hotel at\nDover, and had since improved.\nI should have thought Mr. Lorry began.\nPooh! You'd have thought! said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left\noff.\nHow do you do? inquired that lady thensharply, and yet as if\nto express that she bore him no malice.\nI am pretty well, I thank you, answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness;\nhow are you?\nNothing to boast of, said Miss Pross.\nIndeed?\nAh! indeed! said Miss Pross. I am very much put out about my\nLadybird.\nIndeed?\nFor gracious sake say something else besides `indeed,' or you'll \u0002d-\nget me to death, said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from\nstature) was shortness.\nReally, then? said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\nReally, is bad enough, returned Miss Pross, but better. Yes, I am\nvery much put out.\nMay I ask the cause?\nI don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Lady-\nbird, to come here looking after her, said Miss Pross.\nDo dozens come for that purpose?\nHundreds, said Miss Pross.\nIt was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her\ntime and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,\nshe exaggerated it.\nDear me! said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.\nI have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me, and\npaid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may\ntake your af\u0002davit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her\nfor nothingsince she was ten years old. And it's really very hard, said\nMiss Pross.\nNot seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his\nhead; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that\nwould \u0002t anything.\nAll sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the\npet, are always turning up, said Miss Pross. When you began it\nI began it, Miss Pross?\nDidn't you? Who brought her father to life?\nOh! If that was beginning it said Mr. Lorry.\nIt wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard\nenough; not that I have any fault to \u0002nd with Doctor Manette, except\nthat he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on\nhim, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any\ncircumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds\nand multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven\nhim), to take Ladybird's affections away from me.\nMr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her\nby this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those\nunsel\u0002sh creaturesfound only among womenwho will, for pure love\nand admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have\nlost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were\nnever fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon\ntheir own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that\nthere is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so\nrendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted\nrespect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own\nmindwe all make such arrangements, more or lesshe stationed Miss\nPross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably\nbetter got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.\nThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\nsaid Miss Pross; and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made\na mistake in life.\nHere again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal his-\ntory had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless\nscoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake\nto speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore,\nwith no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's \u0002delity of belief in Solomon\n(deducting a mere tri\u0003e for this slight mistake) was quite a serious mat-\nter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.\nAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people\nof business, he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room\nand had sat down there in friendly relations, let me ask youdoes the\nDoctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?\nNever.\nAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\nAh! returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. But I don't say he\ndon't refer to it within himself.\nDo you believe that he thinks of it much?\nI do, said Miss Pross.\nDo you imagine Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took\nhim up short with:\nNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\nI stand corrected; do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose,\nsometimes?\nNow and then, said Miss Pross.\nDo you suppose, Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in\nhis bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, that Doctor Manette has\nany theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to\nthe cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his\noppressor?\nI don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\nAnd that is?\nThat she thinks he has.\nNow don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am\na mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\nDull? Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\nRather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, No,\nno, no. Surely not. To return to business:Is it not remarkable that\nDoctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all\nwell assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say\nwith me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and\nwe are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so\ndevotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe\nme, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity,\nbut out of zealous interest.\nWell! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll\ntell me, said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, he is\nafraid of the whole subject.\nAfraid?\nIt's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful\nremembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\nknowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may\nnever feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make\nthe subject pleasant, I should think.\nIt was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. True,\nsaid he, and fearful to re\u0003ect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind,\nMiss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that sup-\npression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the\nuneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present con\u0002-\ndence.\nCan't be helped, said Miss Pross, shaking her head. Touch that\nstring, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone. In\nshort, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the\ndead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up\nand down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\nknow then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down,\nin his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking\nup and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never\nsays a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she \u0002nds\nit best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\ntogether, walking up and down together, till her love and company have\nbrought him to himself.\nNotwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there\nwas a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one\nsad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which\ntesti\u0002ed to her possessing such a thing.\nThe corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\nhad begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it\nseemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had\nset it going.\nHere they are! said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;\nand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\nIt was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a pecu-\nliar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, look-\ning for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they\nwould never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though\nthe steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be\nheard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed\nclose at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and\nMiss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.\nMiss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, tak-\ning off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up\nwith the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and fold-\ning her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as\nmuch pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had\nbeen the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleas-\nant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\nher taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do\nplayfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\nchamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\nthem, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\neyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\nhave had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\nbeaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for\nhaving lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds\nof people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the\nful\u0002lment of Miss Pross's prediction.\nDinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements\nof the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\nalways acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\nquality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\ncontrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be bet-\nter. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she\nhad ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impover-\nished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart\nculinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of\nGaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\nwho formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or\nCinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a\nvegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\npleased.\nOn Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other\ndays persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the\nlower regions, or in her own room on the second \u0003oora blue cham-\nber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this\noccasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleas-\nant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very\npleasant, too.\nIt was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\nwine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\nthere in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\nthey went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\nthe special bene\u0002t of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some time\nbefore, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-\ntree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends\nof houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered\nto them in its own way above their heads.\nStill, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\npresented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\nwas only One.\nDoctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss\nPross suddenly became af\u0003icted with a twitching in the head and body,\nand retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\ndisorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, a \u0002t of the jerks.\nThe Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young.\nThe resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times,\nand as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\nhis arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\nlikeness.\nHe had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\nvivacity. Pray, Doctor Manette, said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under\nthe plane-treeand he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\nwhich happened to be the old buildings of Londonhave you seen\nmuch of the Tower?\nLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen\nenough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\nI have been there, as you remember, said Darnay, with a smile,\nthough reddening a little angrily, in another character, and not in a\ncharacter that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\ncurious thing when I was there.\nWhat was that? Lucie asked.\nIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dun-\ngeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every\nstone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been\ncarved by prisonersdates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a\ncorner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have\ngone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were\ndone with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady\nhand. At \u0002rst, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\nexamined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or leg-\nend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were\nmade what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that\nthe letters were not initials, but the complete word, DiG. The \u0003oor was\nexamined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath\na stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a\npaper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What the\nunknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written\nsomething, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.\nMy father, exclaimed Lucie, you are ill!\nHe had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner\nand his look quite terri\u0002ed them all.\nNo, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\nmade me start. We had better go in.\nHe recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in\nlarge drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it.\nBut, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been\ntold of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\neither detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards\nCharles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it\nturned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\nHe recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts\nof his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\nsteady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that\nhe was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\nthat the rain had startled him.\nTea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another \u0002t of the jerks\nupon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in,\nbut he made only Two.\nThe night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\nwindows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table\nwas done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out\ninto the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her;\nCarton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and\nsome of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up\nto the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\nThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few, said Doctor\nManette. It comes slowly.\nIt comes surely, said Carton.\nThey spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as peo-\nple in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\nThere was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\nget shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes re-\nsounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a foot-\nstep was there.\nA multitude of people, and yet a solitude! said Darnay, when they\nhad listened for a while.\nIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay? asked Lucie. Sometimes, I\nhave sat here of an evening, until I have fanciedbut even the shade\nof a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\nsolemn\nLet us shudder too. We may know what it is.\nIt will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as\nwe originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\nsometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the\nechoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-\nbye into our lives.\nThere is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,\nSydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\nThe footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more\nand more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet;\nsome, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room;\nsome coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether;\nall in the distant streets, and not one within sight.\nAre all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette,\nor are we to divide them among us?\nI don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\nasked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\nthen I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\ninto my life, and my father's.\nI take them into mine! said Carton. I ask no questions and make\nno stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss\nManette, and I see themby the Lightning. He added the last words,\nafter there had been a vivid \u0003ash which had shown him lounging in the\nwindow.\nAnd I hear them! he added again, after a peal of thunder. Here\nthey come, fast, \u0002erce, and furious!\nIt was the rush and roar of rain that he typi\u0002ed, and it stopped him,\nfor no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\nlightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's\ninterval in crash, and \u0002re, and rain, until after the moon rose at mid-\nnight.\nThe great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when\nMr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth\non his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of\nroad on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\nof foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually\nperformed a good two hours earlier.\nWhat a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry, said Mr. Lorry,\nto bring the dead out of their graves.\nI never see the night myself, masternor yet I don't expect to\nwhat would do that, answered Jerry.\nGood night, Mr. Carton, said the man of business. Good night,\nMr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!\nPerhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and\nroar, bearing down upon them, too.", "index": 11}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 7, "chapter_title": "Monseigneur in Town", "chapter_text": "Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his\nfortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in\nhis inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to\nthe crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur\nwas about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great\nmany things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to\nbe rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could\nnot so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of\nfour strong men besides the Cook.\nYes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and\nthe Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches\nin his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Mon-\nseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One\nlacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second,\nmilled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for\nthat function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of\nthe two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for\nMonseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate\nand hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have\nbeen the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly\nwaited on by only three men; he must have died of two.\nMonseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the\nComedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Mon-\nseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating com-\npany. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy\nand the Grand Opera had far more in\u0003uence with him in the tiresome\narticles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A\nhappy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries\nsimilarly favoured!always was for England (by way of example), in\nthe regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.\nMonseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business,\nwhich was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public\nbusiness, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all\ngo his waytend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, gen-\neral and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that\nthe world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the\noriginal by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: The earth and the\nfulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.\nYet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments\ncrept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both\nclasses of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to\n\u0002nances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of\nthem, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to\n\u0002nances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur,\nafter generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence\nMonseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet\ntime to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could\nwear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,\npoor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane\nwith a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in\nthe outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankindalways except-\ning superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife\nincluded, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.\nA sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in\nhis stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\nwaited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder\nand forage where he could, the Farmer-Generalhowsoever his matri-\nmonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest\nreality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur\nthat day.\nFor, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned\nwith every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could\nachieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any ref-\nerence to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not\nso far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost\nequidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would\nhave been an exceedingly uncomfortable businessif that could have\nbeen anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military of\u0002-\ncers destitute of military knowledge; naval of\u0002cers with no idea of a\nship; civil of\u0002cers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of\nthe worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser\nlives; all totally un\u0002t for their several callings, all lying horribly in pre-\ntending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of\nMonseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from\nwhich anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score\nand the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur\nor the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or\nwith lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly\nend, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of\ndainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon\ntheir courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors\nwho had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which\nthe State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest\nto root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears\nthey could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving\nPhilosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making\ncard-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving\nChemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this won-\nderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of\nthe \u0002nest breeding, which was at that remarkable timeand has been\nsinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject\nof human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at\nthe hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities\nleft behind them in the \u0002ne world of Paris, that the spies among the\nassembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the po-\nlite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels\nof that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance,\nowned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing\na troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards\nthe realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known\nto the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and\nbrought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and\nsupped as at twenty.\nThe leprosy of unreality dis\u0002gured every human creature in atten-\ndance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen\nexceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving\nin them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising\nway of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of\na fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within\nthemselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on\nthe spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible \u0002nger-post to the Fu-\nture, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other\nthree who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a\njargon about the Centre of Truth: holding that Man had got out of\nthe Centre of Truthwhich did not need much demonstrationbut had\nnot got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from \u0003ying\nout of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Cen-\ntre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\ndiscoursing with spirits went onand it did a world of good which\nnever became manifest.\nBut, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of\nMonseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only\nbeen ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been\neternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair,\nsuch delicate complexions arti\u0002cially preserved and mended, such gal-\nlant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell,\nwould surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gen-\ntlemen of the \u0002nest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as\nthey languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;\nand what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and\n\u0002ne linen, there was a \u0003utter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and\nhis devouring hunger far away.\nDress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping\nall things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that\nwas never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Mon-\nseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of\nJustice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended\nto the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was re-\nquired to of\u0002ciate frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and\nwhite silk stockings. At the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a\nrarityMonsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother\nProfessors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him,\npresided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Mon-\nseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our\nLord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman,\npowdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see\nthe very stars out!\nMonseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken\nhis chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\nopen, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawn-\ning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body\nand spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heavenwhich may have\nbeen one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur\nnever troubled it.\nBestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on\none happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affa-\nbly passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference\nof Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in\ndue course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate\nsprites, and was seen no more.\nThe show being over, the \u0003utter in the air became quite a little storm,\nand the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon\nbut one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm\nand his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his\nway out.\nI devote you, said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,\nand turning in the direction of the sanctuary, to the Devil!\nWith that, he shook the snuff from his \u0002ngers as if he had shaken\nthe dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.\nHe was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in man-\nner, and with a face like a \u0002ne mask. A face of a transparent paleness;\nevery feature in it clearly de\u0002ned; one set expression on it. The nose,\nbeautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of\neach nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change\nthat the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour\nsometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by\nsomething like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery,\nand cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its ca-\npacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth,\nand the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and\nthin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a\nremarkable one.\nIts owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage,\nand drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception;\nhe had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been\nwarmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather\nagreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses,\nand often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if\nhe were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man\nbrought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The com-\nplaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and\ndumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the \u0002erce pa-\ntrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar\nin a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a\nsecond time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches\nwere left to get out of their dif\u0002culties as they could.\nWith a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of con-\nsideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed\nthrough streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before\nit, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way.\nAt last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels\ncame to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number\nof voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\nBut for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not\nhave stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their\nwounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down\nin a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.\nWhat has gone wrong? said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\nA tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the\nfeet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and\nwas down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\nPardon, Monsieur the Marquis! said a ragged and submissive\nman, it is a child.\nWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\nExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquisit is a pityyes.\nThe fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it\nwas, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man\nsuddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage,\nMonsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-\nhilt.\nKilled! shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both\narms at their length above his head, and staring at him. Dead!\nThe people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.\nThere was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but\nwatchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.\nNeither did the people say anything; after the \u0002rst cry, they had been\nsilent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had\nspoken, was \u0003at and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Mar-\nquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out\nof their holes.\nHe took out his purse.\nIt is extraordinary to me, said he, that you people cannot take\ncare of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever\nin the, way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See!\nGive him that.\nHe threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads\ncraned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall\nman called out again with a most unearthly cry, Dead!\nHe was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the\nrest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his\nshoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some\nwomen were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently\nabout it. They were as silent, however, as the men.\nI know all, I know all, said the last comer. Be a brave man, my\nGaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.\nIt has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as\nhappily?\nYou are a philosopher, you there, said the, Marquis, smiling.\nHow do they call you?\nThey call me Defarge.\nOf what trade?\nMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\nPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine, said the Marquis,\nthrowing him another gold coin, and spend it as you will. The horses\nthere; are they right?\nWithout deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur\nthe Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away\nwith the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common\nthing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease\nwas suddenly disturbed by a coin \u0003ying into his carriage, and ringing on\nits \u0003oor.\nHold! said Monsieur the Marquis. Hold the horses! Who threw\nthat?\nHe looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood,\na moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on\nthe pavement in that spot, and the \u0002gure that stood beside him was the\n\u0002gure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\nYou dogs! said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an un-\nchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: I would ride over\nany of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew\nwhich rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were suf\u0002ciently\nnear it, he should be crushed under the wheels.\nSo cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience\nof what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it,\nthat not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men,\nnot one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and\nlooked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it;\nhis contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and\nhe leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word Go on!\nHe was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick\nsuccession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the\nDoctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the\nwhole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous \u0003ow, came whirling by. The rats\nhad crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for\nhours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle,\nand making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they\npeeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself\naway with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it\nlay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the\nwater and the rolling of the Fancy Ballwhen the one woman who had\nstood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of\nFate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into\nevening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time\nand tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their\ndark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran\ntheir course.", "index": 12}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 8, "chapter_title": "Monseigneur in the Country", "chapter_text": "A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.\nPatches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas\nand beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On\ninanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a preva-\nlent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillinglya de-\njected disposition to give up, and wither away.\nMonsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have\nbeen lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged\nup a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis\nwas no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was\noccasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting\nsun.\nThe sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it\ngained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. It will\ndie out, said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, directly.\nIn effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the\nheavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down\nhill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed\nquickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no\nglow left when the drag was taken off.\nBut, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village\nat the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-\ntower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on\nit used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night\ndrew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near\nhome.\nThe village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tan-\nnery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor foun-\ntain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its peo-\nple were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding\nspare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain,\nwashing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth\nthat could be eaten. Expressive sips of what made them poor, were not\nwanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord,\ntax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, ac-\ncording to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was,\nthat there was any village left unswallowed.\nFew children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and\nwomen, their choice on earth was stated in the prospectLife on the\nlowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the\nmill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.\nHeralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postil-\nions' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening\nair, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up\nin his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the\nfountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.\nHe looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure\n\u0002ling down of misery-worn face and \u0002gure, that was to make the mea-\ngreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the\ntruth through the best part of a hundred years.\nMonsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that\ndrooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Mon-\nseigneur of the Courtonly the difference was, that these faces drooped\nmerely to suffer and not to propitiatewhen a grizzled mender of the\nroads joined the group.\nBring me hither that fellow! said the Marquis to the courier.\nThe fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed\nround to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris foun-\ntain.\nI passed you on the road?\nMonseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the\nroad.\nComing up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?\nMonseigneur, it is true.\nWhat did you look at, so \u0002xedly?\nMonseigneur, I looked at the man.\nHe stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the\ncarriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.\nWhat man, pig? And why look there?\nPardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoethe\ndrag.\nWho? demanded the traveller.\nMonseigneur, the man.\nMay the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man?\nYou know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?\nYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the coun-\ntry. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.\nSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?\nWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Mon-\nseigneur. His head hanging overlike this!\nHe turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with\nhis face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recov-\nered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.\nWhat was he like?\nMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,\nwhite as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\nThe picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but\nall eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur\nthe Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his\nconscience.\nTruly, you did well, said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that\nsuch vermin were not to ruf\u0003e him, to see a thief accompanying my\ncarriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside,\nMonsieur Gabelle!\nMonsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing func-\ntionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at\nthis examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm\nin an of\u0002cial manner.\nBah! Go aside! said Monsieur Gabelle.\nLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-\nnight, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\nMonseigneur, I am \u0003attered to devote myself to your orders.\nDid he run away, fellow?where is that Accursed?\nThe accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen\nparticular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some half-\ndozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented\nhim breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.\nDid the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?\nMonseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head \u0002rst,\nas a person plunges into the river.\nSee to it, Gabelle. Go on!\nThe half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the\nwheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky\nto save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they\nmight not have been so fortunate.\nThe burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up\nthe rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,\nit subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the\nmany sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand\ngossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended\nthe points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses;\nthe courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dun distance.\nAt the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with\na Cross and a new large \u0002gure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor \u0002gure\nin wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied\nthe \u0002gure from the lifehis own life, maybefor it was dreadfully spare\nand thin.\nTo this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been\ngrowing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She\nturned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and pre-\nsented herself at the carriage-door.\nIt is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.\nWith an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,\nMonseigneur looked out.\nHow, then! What is it? Always petitions!\nMonseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the\nforester.\nWhat of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you\npeople. He cannot pay something?\nHe has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.\nWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\nAlas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of\npoor grass.\nWell?\nMonseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?\nAgain, well?\nShe looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one\nof passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands\ntogether with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door\ntenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be\nexpected to feel the appealing touch.\nMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My hus-\nband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of\nwant.\nAgain, well? Can I feed them?\nMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition\nis, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be\nplaced over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be\nquickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same\nmalady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Mon-\nseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.\nMonseigneur! Monseigneur!\nThe valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken\ninto a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left\nfar behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly\ndiminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him\nand his chateau.\nThe sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose,\nas the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group\nat the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the\naid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon\nhis man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they\ncould bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled\nin little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more\nstars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having\nbeen extinguished.\nThe shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging\ntrees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow\nwas exchanged for the light of a \u0003ambeau, as his carriage stopped, and\nthe great door of his chateau was opened to him.\nMonsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?\nMonseigneur, not yet.", "index": 13}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 9, "chapter_title": "The Gorgon's Head", "chapter_text": "It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,\nwith a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase\nmeeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business\naltogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone \u0003ow-\ners, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.\nAs if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was \u0002nished, two cen-\nturies ago.\nUp the broad \u0003ight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, \u0003am-\nbeau preceded, went from his carriage, suf\u0002ciently disturbing the dark-\nness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile\nof stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the\n\u0003ambeau carried up the steps, and the other \u0003ambeau held at the great\ndoor, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in\nthe open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,\nsave the failing of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those\ndark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave\na long low sigh, and hold their breath again.\nThe great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis\ncrossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives\nof the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips,\nof which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the\nweight when his lord was angry.\nAvoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the\nnight, Monsieur the Marquis, with his \u0003ambeau-bearer going on before,\nwent up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admit-\nted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber\nand two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted \u0003oors, great\ndogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all\nluxuries be\u0002tting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and coun-\ntry. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to\nbreakthe fourteenth Louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture;\nbut, it was diversi\u0002ed by many objects that were illustrations of old\npages in the history of France.\nA supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round\nroom, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. A small\nlofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds\nclosed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of\nblack, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.\nMy nephew, said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation;\nthey said he was not arrived.\nNor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\nAh! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave\nthe table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.\nIn a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone\nto his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the win-\ndow, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux\nto his lips, when he put it down.\nWhat is that? he calmly asked, looking with attention at the hori-\nzontal lines of black and stone colour.\nMonseigneur? That?\nOutside the blinds. Open the blinds.\nIt was done.\nWell?\nMonseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are\nhere.\nThe servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out\ninto the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking\nround for instructions.\nGood, said the imperturbable master. Close them again.\nThat was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He\nwas half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his\nhand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to\nthe front of the chateau.\nAsk who is arrived.\nIt was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues\nbehind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the\ndistance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on\nthe road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being\nbefore him.\nHe was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then\nand there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he\ncame. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\nMonseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not\nshake hands.\nYou left Paris yesterday, sir? he said to Monseigneur, as he took\nhis seat at table.\nYesterday. And you?\nI come direct.\nFrom London?\nYes.\nYou have been a long time coming, said the Marquis, with a smile.\nOn the contrary; I come direct.\nPardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time\nintending the journey.\nI have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his\nanswervarious business.\nWithout doubt, said the polished uncle.\nSo long as a servant was present, no other words passed between\nthem. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the\nnephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was\nlike a \u0002ne mask, opened a conversation.\nI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\ntook me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\na sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have\nsustained me.\nNot to death, said the uncle; it is not necessary to say, to death.\nI doubt, sir, returned the nephew, whether, if it had carried me\nto the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.\nThe deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the \u0002ne\nstraight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle\nmade a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of\ngood breeding that it was not reassuring.\nIndeed, sir, pursued the nephew, for anything I know, you may\nhave expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the sus-\npicious circumstances that surrounded me.\nNo, no, no, said the uncle, pleasantly.\nBut, however that may be, resumed the nephew, glancing at him\nwith deep distrust, I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any\nmeans, and would know no scruple as to means.\nMy friend, I told you so, said the uncle, with a \u0002ne pulsation in\nthe two marks. Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long\nago.\nI recall it.\nThank you, said the Marquisevery sweetly indeed.\nHis tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instru-\nment.\nIn effect, sir, pursued the nephew, I believe it to be at once your\nbad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\nFrance here.\nI do not quite understand, returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\nDare I ask you to explain?\nI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had\nnot been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet\nwould have sent me to some fortress inde\u0002nitely.\nIt is possible, said the uncle, with great calmness. For the honour\nof the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\nPray excuse me!\nI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\nyesterday was, as usual, a cold one, observed the nephew.\nI would not say happily, my friend, returned the uncle, with re-\n\u0002ned politeness; I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity\nfor consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might in-\n\u0003uence your destiny to far greater advantage than you in\u0003uence it for\nyourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a\ndisadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to\nthe power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so in-\ncommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.\nThey are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so\nfew! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the\nworse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over\nthe surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been\ntaken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to\nour knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent\ndelicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter? We have lost many priv-\nileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our\nstation, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but\nmight) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!\nThe Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\nas elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\ncontaining himself, that great means of regeneration.\nWe have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the\nmodern time also, said the nephew, gloomily, that I believe our name\nto be more detested than any name in France.\nLet us hope so, said the uncle. Detestation of the high is the\ninvoluntary homage of the low.\nThere is not, pursued the nephew, in his former tone, a face I can\nlook at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\ndeference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.\nA compliment, said the Marquis, to the grandeur of the family,\nmerited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\nHah! And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\ncrossed his legs.\nBut, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his\neyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the \u0002ne mask looked at\nhim sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and\ndislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indiffer-\nence.\nRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of\nfear and slavery, my friend, observed the Marquis, will keep the dogs\nobedient to the whip, as long as this roof, looking up to it, shuts out\nthe sky.\nThat might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of\nthe chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of \u0002fty like it as\nthey too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\nhim that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the\nghastly, \u0002re-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted,\nhe might have found that shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit, for\never, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was \u0002red, out of the\nbarrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\nMeanwhile, said the Marquis, I will preserve the honour and\nrepose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\nterminate our conference for the night?\nA moment more.\nAn hour, if you please.\nSir, said the nephew, we have done wrong, and are reaping the\nfruits of wrong.\nWe have done wrong? repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring\nsmile, and delicately pointing, \u0002rst to his nephew, then to himself.\nOur family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much\naccount to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time,\nwe did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came\nbetween us and our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of\nmy father's time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's\ntwin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?\nDeath has done that! said the Marquis.\nAnd has left me, answered the nephew, bound to a system that is\nfrightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute\nthe last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my\ndear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress;\nand tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.\nSeeking them from me, my nephew, said the Marquis, touching\nhim on the breast with his fore\u0002ngerthey were now standing by the\nhearthyou will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.\nEvery \u0002ne straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly,\ncraftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his\nnephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him\non the breast, as though his \u0002nger were the \u0002ne point of a small sword,\nwith which, in delicate \u0002nesse, he ran him through the body, and said,\nMy friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\nlived.\nWhen he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put\nhis box in his pocket.\nBetter to be a rational creature, he added then, after ringing a\nsmall bell on the table, and accept your natural destiny. But you are\nlost, Monsieur Charles, I see.\nThis property and France are lost to me, said the nephew, sadly;\nI renounce them.\nAre they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the prop-\nerty? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?\nI had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\nto me from you, to-morrow\nWhich I have the vanity to hope is not probable.\nor twenty years hence\nYou do me too much honour, said the Marquis; still, I prefer that\nsupposition.\nI would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little\nto relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!\nHah! said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\nTo the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the\nsky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanage-\nment, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and\nsuffering.\nHah! said the Marquis again, in a well-satis\u0002ed manner.\nIf it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qual-\ni\u0002ed to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that\ndrags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who\nhave been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another\ngeneration, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse on it, and\non all this land.\nAnd you? said the uncle. Forgive my curiosity; do you, under\nyour new philosophy, graciously intend to live?\nI must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobil-\nity at their backs, may have to do some day-work.\nIn England, for example?\nYes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\nfamily name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.\nThe ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to\nbe lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.\nThe Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\nvalet.\nEngland is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\nprospered there, he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\nwith a smile.\nI have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I\nmay be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.\nThey say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\nknow a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?\nYes.\nWith a daughter?\nYes.\nYes, said the Marquis. You are fatigued. Good night!\nAs he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\nin his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\nwhich struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time,\nthe thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight\nlips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked\nhandsomely diabolic.\nYes, repeated the Marquis. A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\ncommences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\nIt would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face out-\nside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked\nat him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\nGood night! said the uncle. I look to the pleasure of seeing you\nagain in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\nchamber there!And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\nhe added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned\nhis valet to his own bedroom.\nThe valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro\nin his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot\nstill night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making\nno noise on the \u0003oor, he moved like a re\u0002ned tiger:looked like some\nenchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose pe-\nriodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming\non.\nHe moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking\nagain at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his\nmind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the\nmill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants\nat the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out\nthe chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\nthe little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\ntall man with his arms up, crying, Dead!\nI am cool now, said Monsieur the Marquis, and may go to bed.\nSo, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\ngauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\nwith a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\nThe stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\nfor three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\nrattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\nvery little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the\nowl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly\never to say what is set down for them.\nFor three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and hu-\nman, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\ndead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\nThe burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\nwere undistinguishable from one another; the \u0002gure on the Cross might\nhave come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\ntaxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\nthe starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the\nyoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.\nThe fountain in the village \u0003owed unseen and unheard, and the foun-\ntain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheardboth melting away,\nlike the minutes that were falling from the spring of Timethrough\nthree dark hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in\nthe light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\nLighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\ntrees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of\nthe chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crim-\nsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-\nbeaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the\nMarquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this,\nthe nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth\nand dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\nNow, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Case-\nment windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came\nforth shiveringchilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the\nrarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to\nthe fountain; some, to the \u0002elds; men and women here, to dig and delve;\nmen and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony\ncows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the\nchurch and at the Cross, a kneeling \u0002gure or two; attendant on the lat-\nter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its\nfoot.\nThe chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually\nand surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had\nbeen reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning\nsunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their\nstables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pour-\ning in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows,\ndogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\nAll these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\nreturn of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\nchateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried \u0002g-\nures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\neverywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\nWhat winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads,\nalready at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner\n(not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while\nto peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains\nof it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?\nWhether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for\nhis life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got\nto the fountain.\nAll the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in\ntheir depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emo-\ntions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in\nand tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly\non, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\ntrouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of\nthe people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and\nall the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded\non the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly\nfraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into\nthe midst of a group of \u0002fty particular friends, and was smiting himself\nin the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what por-\ntended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on\nhorseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden\nthough the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German\nballad of Leonora?\nIt portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the\nchateau.\nThe Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had\nadded the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited\nthrough about two hundred years.\nIt lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a \u0002ne\nmask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petri\u0002ed. Driven home into\nthe heart of the stone \u0002gure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt\nwas a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:\nDrive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.", "index": 14}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 10, "chapter_title": "Two Promises", "chapter_text": "More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr.\nCharles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the\nFrench language who was conversant with French literature. In this age,\nhe would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read\nwith young men who could \u0002nd any leisure and interest for the study\nof a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste\nfor its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides,\nin sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters\nwere not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that\nwere to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had\ndropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tu-\ntor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and\npro\u0002table, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his\nwork besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon be-\ncame known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with\nthe circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing inter-\nest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.\nIn London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold,\nnor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation,\nhe would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it,\nand did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.\nA certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he\nread with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a\ncontraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek\nand Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in\nLondon.\nNow, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these\ndays when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has\ninvariably gone one wayCharles Darnay's waythe way of the love\nof a woman.\nHe had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had\nnever heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassion-\nate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when\nit was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been\ndug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assas-\nsination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and\nthe long, tong, dusty roadsthe solid stone chateau which had itself\nbecome the mere mist of a dreamhad been done a year, and he had\nnever yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state\nof his heart.\nThat he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a\nsummer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,\nhe turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity\nof opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer\nday, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\nHe found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The\nenergy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and\naggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He\nwas now a very energetic man indeed, with great \u0002rmness of purpose,\nstrength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy\nhe was sometimes a little \u0002tful and sudden, as he had at \u0002rst been in\nthe exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been\nfrequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\nHe studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with\nease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay,\nat sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.\nCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on\nyour return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Car-\nton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than\ndue.\nI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter, he answered,\na little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. Miss\nManette\nIs well, said the Doctor, as he stopped short, and your return\nwill delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but\nwill soon be home.\nDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportu-\nnity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\nThere was a blank silence.\nYes? said the Doctor, with evident constraint. Bring your chair\nhere, and speak on.\nHe complied as to the chair, but appeared to \u0002nd the speaking on\nless easy.\nI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate\nhere, so he at length began, for some year and a half, that I hope the\ntopic on which I am about to touch may not\nHe was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him.\nWhen he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:\nIs Lucie the topic?\nShe is.\nIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me\nto hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\nIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doc-\ntor Manette! he said deferentially.\nThere was another blank silence before her father rejoined:\nI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\nHis constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that\nit originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles\nDarnay hesitated.\nShall I go on, sir?\nAnother blank.\nYes, go on.\nYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how\nearnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret\nheart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long\nbeen laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,\ndisinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.\nYou have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\nThe Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the\nground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,\nand cried:\nNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\nHis cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Dar-\nnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had\nextended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter\nso received it, and remained silent.\nI ask your pardon, said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some\nmoments. I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satis\u0002ed of\nit.\nHe turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or\nraise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair\novershadowed his face:\nHave you spoken to Lucie?\nNo.\nNor written?\nNever.\nIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial\nis to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks\nyou.\nHe offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.\nI know, said Darnay, respectfully, how can I fail to know, Doctor\nManette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between\nyou and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching,\nso belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that\nit can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and\nchild. I know, Doctor Manettehow can I fail to knowthat, mingled\nwith the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman,\nthere is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy\nitself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is\nnow devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present\nyears and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the\nearly days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if\nyou had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could\nhardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that\nin which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to\nyou, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your\nneck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her\nown age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,\nloves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I\nhave known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\nHer father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a\nlittle quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.\nDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and\nyou with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne,\nas long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even\nnow feel, that to bring my loveeven minebetween you, is to touch\nyour history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.\nHeaven is my witness that I love her!\nI believe it, answered her father, mournfully. I have thought so\nbefore now. I believe it.\nBut, do not believe, said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful\nvoice struck with a reproachful sound, that if my fortune were so cast\nas that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any\ntime put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe\na word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless,\nI should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a\nremote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my\nheartif it ever had been thereif it ever could be thereI could not\nnow touch this honoured hand.\nHe laid his own upon it as he spoke.\nNo, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France;\nlike you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries;\nlike you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting\nin a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your\nlife and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with\nLucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in\naid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.\nHis touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch\nfor a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms\nof his chair, and looked up for the \u0002rst time since the beginning of the\nconference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that\noccasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.\nYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I\nthank you with all my heart, and will open all my heartor nearly\nso. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\nNone. As yet, none.\nIs it the immediate object of this con\u0002dence, that you may at once\nascertain that, with my knowledge?\nNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I\nmight (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\nDo you seek any guidance from me?\nI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have\nit in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\nDo you seek any promise from me?\nI do seek that.\nWhat is it?\nI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well\nunderstand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her\ninnocent heart-do not think I have the presumption to assume so much\nI could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\nIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\nI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any\nsuitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which\nreason, Doctor Manette, said Darnay, modestly but \u0002rmly, I would\nnot ask that word, to save my life.\nI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love,\nas well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and\ndelicate, and dif\u0002cult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one\nrespect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her\nheart.\nMay I ask, sir, if you think she is As he hesitated, her father\nsupplied the rest.\nIs sought by any other suitor?\nIt is what I meant to say.\nHer father considered a little before he answered:\nYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,\noccasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\nOr both, said Darnay.\nI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You\nwant a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\nIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her\nown part, such a con\u0002dence as I have ventured to lay before you, you\nwill bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope\nyou may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no in\u0003uence against\nme. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The\ncondition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to\nrequire, I will observe immediately.\nI give the promise, said the Doctor, without any condition. I\nbelieve your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it.\nI believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties\nbetween me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me\nthat you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If\nthere wereCharles Darnay, if there were\nThe young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were\njoined as the Doctor spoke:\nany fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatso-\never, new or old, against the man she really lovedthe direct responsi-\nbility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for\nher sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to\nme than wrong, more to meWell! This is idle talk.\nSo strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange\nhis \u0002xed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own\nhand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.\nYou said something to me, said Doctor Manette, breaking into a\nsmile. What was it you said to me?\nHe was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken\nof a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:\nYour con\u0002dence in me ought to be returned with full con\u0002dence\non my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my\nmother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what\nthat is, and why I am in England.\nStop! said the Doctor of Beauvais.\nI wish it, that I may the better deserve your con\u0002dence, and have\nno secret from you.\nStop!\nFor an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for\nanother instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.\nTell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if\nLucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do\nyou promise?\nWillingly.\nGive me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she\nshould not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!\nIt was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later\nand darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone\nfor Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairsand was surprised to \u0002nd\nhis reading-chair empty.\nMy father! she called to him. Father dear!\nNothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound\nin his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked\nin at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with\nher blood all chilled, What shall I do! What shall I do!\nHer uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped\nat his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of\nher voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and\ndown together for a long time.\nShe came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night.\nHe slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old un\u0002n-\nished work, were all as usual.", "index": 15}

The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver\narrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until\nNovember should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and\nbring grist to the mill again.\nSydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much appli-\ncation. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through\nthe night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the\ntowelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled\nhis turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at\nintervals for the last six hours.\nAre you mixing that other bowl of punch? said Stryver the portly,\nwith his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he\nlay on his back.\nI am.\nNow, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather\nsurprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as\nshrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.\nDo you?\nYes. And not for money. What do you say now?\nI don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?\nGuess.\nDo I know her?\nGuess.\nI am not going to guess, at \u0002ve o'clock in the morning, with my\nbrains frying and sputtering in my head. if you want me to guess, you\nmust ask me to dinner.\nWell then, I'll tell you, said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting\nposture. Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,\nbecause you are such an insensible dog.\nAnd you, returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, are such\na sensitive and poetical spirit\nCome! rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, though I don't pre-\nfer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better),\nstill I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you.\nYou are a luckier, if you mean that.\nI don't mean that. I mean I am a man of moremore\nSay gallantry, while you are about it, suggested Carton.\nWell! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man, said\nStryver, in\u0003ating himself at his friend as he made the punch, who cares\nmore to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows\nbetter how to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do.\nGo on, said Sydney Carton.\nNo; but before I go on, said Stryver, shaking his head in his bul-\nlying way, I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's\nhouse as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been\nashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that\nsilent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have\nbeen ashamed of you, Sydney¡`\nIt should be very bene\u0002cial to a man in your practice at the bar,\nto be ashamed of anything, returned Sydney; you ought to be much\nobliged to me.\nYou shall not get off in that way, rejoined Stryver, shouldering the\nrejoinder at him; no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell youand I tell you to\nyour face to do you goodthat you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow\nin that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.\nSydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.\nLook at me! said Stryver, squaring himself; I have less need\nto make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in\ncircumstances. Why do I do it?\nI never saw you do it yet, muttered Carton.\nI do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I\nget on.\nYou don't get on with your account of your matrimonial inten-\ntions, answered Carton, with a careless air; I wish you would keep to\nthat. As to mewill you never understand that I am incorrigible?\nHe asked the question with some appearance of scorn.\nYou have no business to be incorrigible, was his friend's answer,\ndelivered in no very soothing tone.\nI have no business to be, at all, that I know of, said Sydney Carton.\nWho is the lady?\nNow, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncom-\nfortable, Sydney, said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious\nfriendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, because I know\nyou don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no\nimportance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the\nyoung lady to me in slighting terms.\nI did?\nCertainly; and in these chambers.\nSydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent\nfriend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.\nYou made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The\nyoung lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitive-\nness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been\na little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.\nYou want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when\nI think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion\nof a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music\nof mine, who had no ear for music.\nSydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,\nlooking at his friend.\nNow you know all about it, Syd, said Mr. Stryver. I don't care\nabout fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind\nto please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She\nwill have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,\nand a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but\nshe is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?\nCarton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, Why should I be aston-\nished?\nYou approve?\nCarton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, Why should I not ap-\nprove?\nWell! said his friend Stryver, you take it more easily than I fan-\ncied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought\nyou would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time\nthat your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I\nhave had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it;\nI feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels\ninclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel that\nMiss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit.\nSo I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say\na word to you about your prospects. You are in a bad way, you know;\nyou really are in a bad way. You don't know the value of money, you\nlive hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you\nreally ought to think about a nurse.\nThe prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look\ntwice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.\nNow, let me recommend you, pursued Stryver, to look it in the\nface. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the\nface, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care\nof you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor\nunderstanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some\nrespectable woman with a little propertysomebody in the landlady\nway, or lodging-letting wayand marry her, against a rainy day. That's\nthe kind of thing for you. Now think of it, Sydney.\nI'll think of it, said Sydney.", "index": 16}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 12, "chapter_title": "The Fellow of Delicacy", "chapter_text": "Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of\ngood fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness\nknown to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some\nmental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would\nbe as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then ar-\nrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\nbefore Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\nand Hilary.\nAs to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but\nclearly saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial\nworldly groundsthe only grounds ever worth taking into accountit\nwas a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for\nthe plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the\ndefendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.\nAfter trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satis\u0002ed that no plainer case could be.\nAccordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a for-\nmal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing,\nto Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present\nhimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\nTowards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the\nTemple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon\nit. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he\nwas yet on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown\nway along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might\nhave seen how safe and strong he was.\nHis way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's\nand knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered\nMr. Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the bright-\nness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak\nrattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two an-\ncient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where\nMr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for \u0002gures, with perpendicular iron\nbars to his window as if that were ruled for \u0002gures too, and everything\nunder the clouds were a sum.\nHalloa! said Mr. Stryver. How do you do? I hope you are well!\nIt was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for\nany place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks\nin distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\nsqueezed them against the wall. The House itself, magni\u0002cently reading\nthe paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the\nStryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.\nThe discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would\nrecommend under the circumstances, How do you do, Mr. Stryver?\nHow do you do, sir? and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in\nhis manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's\nwho shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He\nshook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.\nCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver? asked Mr. Lorry, in his\nbusiness character.\nWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I\nhave come for a private word.\nOh indeed! said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye\nstrayed to the House afar off.\nI am going, said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms con\u0002dentially on the\ndesk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to\nbe not half desk enough for him: I am going to make an offer of myself\nin marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\nOh dear me! cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his\nvisitor dubiously.\nOh dear me, sir? repeated Stryver, drawing back. Oh dear you,\nsir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\nMy meaning, answered the man of business, is, of course,\nfriendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and\nin short, my meaning is everything you could desire. Butreally, you\nknow, Mr. Stryver Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him\nin the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add,\ninternally, you know there really is so much too much of you!\nWell! said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,\nopening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, if I understand you,\nMr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\nMr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards\nthat end, and bit the feather of a pen.\nDn it all, sir! said Stryver, staring at him, am I not eligible?\nOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible! said Mr. Lorry. If you\nsay eligible, you are eligible.\nAm I not prosperous? asked Stryver.\nOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous, said Mr.\nLorry.\nAnd advancing?\nIf you come to advancing you know, said Mr. Lorry, delighted to\nbe able to make another admission, nobody can doubt that.\nThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry? demanded\nStryver, perceptibly crestfallen.\nWell! IWere you going there now? asked Mr. Lorry.\nStraight! said Stryver, with a plump of his \u0002st on the desk.\nThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\nWhy? said Stryver. Now, I'll put you in a corner, forensically\nshaking a fore\u0002nger at him. You are a man of business and bound to\nhave a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\nBecause, said Mr. Lorry, I wouldn't go on such an object without\nhaving some cause to believe that I should succeed.\nDn me! cried Stryver, but this beats everything.\nMr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry\nStryver.\nHere's a man of businessa man of yearsa man of experience\nin a Bank, said Stryver; and having summed up three leading reasons\nfor complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his\nhead on! Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\nbeen in\u0002nitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\nWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady;\nand when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I\nspeak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.\nThe young lady, my good sir, said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver\narm, the young lady. The young lady goes before all.\nThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry, said Stryver, squaring his\nelbows, that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present\nin question is a mincing Fool?\nNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver, said Mr. Lorry,\nreddening, that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\nfrom any lips; and that if I knew any manwhich I hope I do not\nwhose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that\nhe could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young\nlady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece\nof my mind.\nThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr.\nStryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to\nbe angry; Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually\nbe, were in no better state now it was his turn.\nThat is what I mean to tell you, sir, said Mr. Lorry. Pray let there\nbe no mistake about it.\nMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then\nstood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him\nthe toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\nThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise\nme not to go up to Soho and offer myselfmyself, Stryver of the King's\nBench bar?\nDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\nYes, I do.\nVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\nAnd all I can say of it is, laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, that\nthisha, ha!beats everything past, present, and to come.\nNow understand me, pursued Mr. Lorry. As a man of business,\nI am not justi\u0002ed in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\nbusiness, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\nMiss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette\nand of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I\nhave spoken. The con\u0002dence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you\nthink I may not be right?\nNot I! said Stryver, whistling. I can't undertake to \u0002nd third\nparties in common sense; I can only \u0002nd it for myself. I suppose sense in\ncertain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's\nnew to me, but you are right, I dare say.\nWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself\nAnd understand me, sir, said Mr. Lorry, quickly \u0003ushing again, I will\nnotnot even at Tellson'shave it characterised for me by any gentle-\nman breathing.\nThere! I beg your pardon! said Stryver.\nGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:it\nmight be painful to you to \u0002nd yourself mistaken, it might be painful\nto Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might\nbe very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with\nyou. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness\nto stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, rep-\nresenting you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the\nexercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to\nbear upon it. If you should then be dissatis\u0002ed with it, you can but test\nits soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satis\u0002ed\nwith it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\nbest spared. What do you say?\nHow long would you keep me in town?\nOh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\nevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\nThen I say yes, said Stryver: I won't go up there now, I am not\nso hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\nin to-night. Good morning.\nThen Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\nconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bow-\ning behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of\nthe two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always\nseen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed,\nwhen they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the\nempty of\u0002ce until they bowed another customer in.\nThe barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not\nhave gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground\nthan moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had\nto swallow, he got it down. And now, said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\nforensic fore\u0002nger at the Temple in general, when it was down, my\nway out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\nIt was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\ngreat relief. You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady, said Mr.\nStryver; I'll do that for you.\nAccordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,\nMr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\npurpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\nthe morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\naltogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\nWell! said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\nbootless attempts to bring him round to the question. I have been to\nSoho.\nTo Soho? repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. Oh, to be sure! What am\nI thinking of!\nAnd I have no doubt, said Mr. Lorry, that I was right in the con-\nversation we had. My opinion is con\u0002rmed, and I reiterate my advice.\nI assure you, returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, that I\nam sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's\naccount. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\nus say no more about it.\nI don't understand you, said Mr. Lorry.\nI dare say not, rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing\nand \u0002nal way; no matter, no matter.\nBut it does matter, Mr. Lorry urged.\nNo it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there\nwas sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there\nis not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm\nis done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and\nhave repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an un-\nsel\u0002sh aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would\nhave been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a sel\u0002sh as-\npect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been\na bad thing for me in a worldly point of viewit is hardly necessary to\nsay I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I\nhave not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by\nno means certain, on re\u0003ection, that I ever should have committed my-\nself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities\nand giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or\nyou will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I\ntell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satis\u0002ed on my own\naccount. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to\nsound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady\nbetter than I do; you were right, it never would have done.\nMr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.\nStryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of show-\nering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. Make\nthe best of it, my dear sir, said Stryver; say no more about it; thank\nyou again for allowing me to sound you; good night!\nMr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr.\nStryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.", "index": 17}

He had been there often, during a whole year,\nand had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When\nhe cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,\nwhich overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely\npierced by the light within him.\nAnd yet he did care something for the streets that environed that\nhouse, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a\nnight he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought\nno transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his soli-\ntary \u0002gure lingering there, and still lingering there when the \u0002rst beams\nof the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in\nspires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought\nsome sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his\nmind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him\nmore scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon\nit no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that\nneighbourhood.\nOn a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal\nthat he had thought better of that marrying matter) had carried his\ndelicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of \u0003owers in the\nCity streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health\nfor the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod those\nstones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated\nby an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him\nto the Doctor's door.\nHe was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She\nhad never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some\nlittle embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking\nup at his face in the interchange of the \u0002rst few common-places, she\nobserved a change in it.\nI fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\nNo. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.\nWhat is to be expected of, or by, such pro\u0003igates?\nIs it notforgive me; I have begun the question on my lipsa pity\nto live no better life?\nGod knows it is a shame!\nThen why not change it?\nLooking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see\nthat there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he\nanswered:\nIt is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink\nlower, and be worse.\nHe leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.\nThe table trembled in the silence that followed.\nShe had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew\nher to be so, without looking at her, and said:\nPray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge\nof what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?\nIf it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,\nit would make me very glad!\nGod bless you for your sweet compassion!\nHe unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.\nDon't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am\nlike one who died young. All my life might have been.\nNo, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I\nam sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.\nSay of you, Miss Manette, and although I know betteralthough\nin the mystery of my own wretched heart I know betterI shall never\nforget it!\nShe was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a \u0002xed\ndespair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could\nhave been holden.\nIf it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have re-\nturned the love of the man you see before yourself\u0003ung away, wasted,\ndrunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to behe would\nhave been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he\nwould bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight\nyou, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you\ncan have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that\nit cannot be.\nWithout it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you\nforgive me again!to a better course? Can I in no way repay your\ncon\u0002dence? I know this is a con\u0002dence, she modestly said, after a little\nhesitation, and in earnest tears, I know you would say this to no one\nelse. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?\nHe shook his head.\nTo none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a\nvery little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know\nthat you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have\nnot been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and\nof this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I\nthought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a\nremorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard\nwhispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were\nsilent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning\nanew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and \u0002ghting out the abandoned\n\u0002ght. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper\nwhere he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.\nWill nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\nNo, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite\nundeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weak-\nness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled\nme, heap of ashes that I am, into \u0002rea \u0002re, however, inseparable in\nits nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no\nservice, idly burning away.\nSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more\nunhappy than you were before you knew me\nDon't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if\nanything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\nSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,\nattributable to some in\u0003uence of minethis is what I mean, if I can\nmake it plaincan I use no in\u0003uence to serve you? Have I no power for\ngood, with you, at all?\nThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have\ncome here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected\nlife, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the\nworld; and that there was something left in me at this time which you\ncould deplore and pity.\nWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently,\nwith all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\nEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved\nmyself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will\nyou let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last con\u0002dence of my\nlife was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there\nalone, and will be shared by no one?\nIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\nNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\nMr. Carton, she answered, after an agitated pause, the secret is\nyours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\nThank you. And again, God bless you.\nHe put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.\nBe under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this\nconversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it again.\nIf I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In the hour\nof my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembranceand shall\nthank and bless you for itthat my last avowal of myself was made to\nyou, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in\nyour heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!\nHe was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was\nso sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every\nday kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for\nhim as he stood looking back at her.\nBe comforted! he said, I am not worth such feeling, Miss\nManette. An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low\nhabits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as\nthose, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But,\nwithin myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though\noutwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last suppli-\ncation but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.\nI will, Mr. Carton.\nMy last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you\nof a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and\nbetween whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to\nsay it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear\nto you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that\nthere was any opportunity or capacity of sacri\u0002ce in it, I would embrace\nany sacri\u0002ce for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your\nmind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The\ntime will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will\nbe formed about youties that will bind you yet more tenderly and\nstrongly to the home you so adornthe dearest ties that will ever grace\nand gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy\nfather's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty\nspringing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man\nwho would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\nHe said, Farewell! said a last God bless you! and left her.", "index": 18}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 14, "chapter_title": "The Honest Tradesman", "chapter_text": "To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street\nwith his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects\nin movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything\nin Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and\ndeafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with\nthe sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending\nto the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes\ndown!\nWith his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two\nstreams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on\nduty watching one streamsaving that Jerry had no expectation of their\never running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful\nkind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of\ntimid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life)\nfrom Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such com-\npanionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to\nbecome so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have\nthe honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts\nbestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose,\nthat he recruited his \u0002nances, as just now observed.\nTime was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused\nin the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,\nbut not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\nIt fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\nfew, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\nunprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\nCruncher must have been \u0003opping in some pointed manner, when an\nunusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\nattention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\nfuneral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\nfuneral, which engendered uproar.\nYoung Jerry, said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, it's a\nburyin'.\nHooroar, father! cried Young Jerry.\nThe young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\nsigni\u0002cance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\nhis opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\nWhat d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want\nto conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting\ntoo many for me! said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. Him and his\nhooroars! Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some\nmore of me. D'ye hear?\nI warn't doing no harm, Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\nDrop it then, said Mr. Cruncher; I won't have none of your no\nharms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.\nHis son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling\nand hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which\nmourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trap-\npings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The\nposition appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increas-\ning rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at\nhim, and incessantly groaning and calling out: Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha!\nSpies! with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\nFunerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher;\nhe always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral\npassed Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon\nattendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the \u0002rst man who ran\nagainst him:\nWhat is it, brother? What's it about?\nI don't know, said the man. Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\nHe asked another man. Who is it?\nI don't know, returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\nnevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest\nardour, Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spiies!\nAt length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tum-\nbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was\nthe funeral of one Roger Cly.\nWas He a spy? asked Mr. Cruncher.\nOld Bailey spy, returned his informant. Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old\nBailey Spiiies!\nWhy, to be sure! exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he\nhad assisted. I've seen him. Dead, is he?\nDead as mutton, returned the other, and can't be too dead. Have\n'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!\nThe idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that\nthe crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the sugges-\ntion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so\nclosely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach\ndoors, the one mourner scuf\u0003ed out of himself and was in their hands\nfor a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\nthat in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\nshedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\nother symbolical tears.\nThese, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with\ngreat enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for\na crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much\ndreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take\nthe cof\u0002n out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being\nescorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions\nbeing much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation,\nand the coach was immediately \u0002lled with eight inside and a dozen out,\nwhile as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\nexercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the \u0002rst of these volunteers\nwas Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head\nfrom the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning\ncoach.\nThe of\u0002ciating undertakers made some protest against these changes\nin the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several\nvoices remarking on the ef\u0002cacy of cold immersion in bringing refrac-\ntory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and\nbrief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driv-\ning the hearseadvised by the regular driver, who was perched beside\nhim, under close inspection, for the purposeand with a pieman, also\nattended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-\nleader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an ad-\nditional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand;\nand his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking\nair to that part of the procession in which he walked.\nThus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and in\u0002nite\ncaricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\nat every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\nwas the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the \u0002elds. It got there\nin course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; \u0002nally,\naccomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way,\nand highly to its own satisfaction.\nThe dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity\nof providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter ge-\nnius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\npassers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\nwas given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been\nnear the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\nthey were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\nwindow-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was\neasy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-\nhouses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up,\nto arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards\nwere coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and\nperhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was\nthe usual progress of a mob.\nMr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\nbehind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\nThe place had a soothing in\u0003uence on him. He procured a pipe from\na neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings\nand maturely considering the spot.\nJerry, said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\nyou see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\nwas a young 'un and a straight made 'un.\nHaving smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\nhimself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\nstation at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\nhis liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss,\nor whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not\nso much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical\nadvisera distinguished surgeonon his way back.\nYoung Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported\nNo job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out,\nthe usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to\ntea.\nNow, I tell you where it is! said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\nentering. If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night,\nI shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work\nyou for it just the same as if I seen you do it.\nThe dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\nWhy, you're at it afore my face! said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\nangry apprehension.\nI am saying nothing.\nWell, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well \u0003op as med-\nitate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it alto-\ngether.\nYes, Jerry.\nYes, Jerry, repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. Ah! It is\nyes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\nMr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corrobora-\ntions, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express\ngeneral ironical dissatisfaction.\nYou and your yes, Jerry, said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of\nhis bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\noyster out of his saucer. Ah! I think so. I believe you.\nYou are going out to-night? asked his decent wife, when he took\nanother bite.\nYes, I am.\nMay I go with you, father? asked his son, briskly.\nNo, you mayn't. I'm a goingas your mother knowsa \u0002shing.\nThat's where I'm going to. Going a \u0002shing.\nYour \u0002shing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?\nNever you mind.\nShall you bring any \u0002sh home, father?\nIf I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow, returned that\ngentleman, shaking his head; that's questions enough for you; I ain't a\ngoing out, till you've been long abed.\nHe devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping\na most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\nconversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\nto his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in con-\nversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\non any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he\nwould leave her for a moment to her own re\u0003ections. The devoutest per-\nson could have rendered no greater homage to the ef\u0002cacy of an honest\nprayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed\nunbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.\nAnd mind you! said Mr. Cruncher. No games to-morrow! If\nI, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two,\nnone of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest\ntradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on\nwater. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly\ncustomer to you, if you don't. I'm your Rome, you know.\nThen he began grumbling again:\nWith your \u0003ying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I\ndon't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by\nyour \u0003opping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he\nis your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,\nand not know that a mother's \u0002rst duty is to blow her boy out?\nThis touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother\nto perform her \u0002rst duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above\nall things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function\nso affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.\nThus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young\nJerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,\nobeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night\nwith solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly\none o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his\nchair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and\nbrought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain,\nand other \u0002shing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about\nhim in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting de\u0002ance on Mrs. Cruncher,\nextinguished the light, and went out.\nYoung Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went\nto bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he\nfollowed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\ncourt, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\nhis getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door\nstood ajar all night.\nImpelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\nfather's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,\nwalls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his hon-\noured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had\nnot gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton,\nand the two trudged on together.\nWithin half an hour from the \u0002rst starting, they were beyond the\nwinking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out\nupon a lonely road. Another \u0002sherman was picked up hereand that\nso silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have\nsupposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden,\nsplit himself into two.\nThe three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\nunder a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was\na low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of\nbank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of\nwhich the wallthere, risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one\nside. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object\nthat Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\nde\u0002ned against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\nHe was soon over, and then the second \u0002sherman got over, and then the\nthird. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\nthere a littlelistening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\nand knees.\nIt was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,\nholding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and look-\ning in, he made out the three \u0002shermen creeping through some rank\ngrass! and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large church-\nyard that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white, while the\nchurch tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They\ndid not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they\nbegan to \u0002sh.\nThey \u0002shed with a spade, at \u0002rst. Presently the honoured parent\nappeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. What-\never tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking\nof the church clock so terri\u0002ed Young Jerry, that he made off, with his\nhair as stiff as his father's.\nBut, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters,\nnot only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.\nThey were still \u0002shing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\nthe second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was\na screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent \u0002gures\nwere strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away\nthe earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew\nwhat it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent\nabout to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight,\nthat he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or\nmore.\nHe would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than\nbreath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desir-\nable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the cof\u0002n he had seen\nwas running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt up-\nright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and\nhopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to\nshun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous \u0002end too, for, while it was\nmaking the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\nroadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\nlike a dropsical boy's-Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\ntoo, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\nto its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and\nlay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly\nhopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his\nown door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would\nnot leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair,\nscrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\nhis breast when he fell asleep.\nFrom his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened\nafter daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\nfamily room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young\nJerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by\nthe ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of\nthe bed.\nI told you I would, said Mr. Cruncher, and I did.\nJerry, Jerry, Jerry! his wife implored.\nYou oppose yourself to the pro\u0002t of the business, said Jerry, and\nme and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil\ndon't you?\nI try to be a good wife, Jerry, the poor woman protested, with\ntears.\nIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it\nhonouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\nhusband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?\nYou hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.\nIt's enough for you, retorted Mr. Cruncher, to be the wife of a\nhonest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calcula-\ntions when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and\nobeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a reli-\ngious woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!\nYou have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames\nriver has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.\nThe altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and termi-\nnated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and\nlying down at his length on the \u0003oor. After taking a timid peep at him\nlying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his\nson lay down too, and fell asleep again.\nThere was no \u0002sh for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.\nCruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-\nlid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case\nhe should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed\nand washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his\nostensible calling.\nYoung Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's\nside along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young\nJerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness\nand solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,\nand his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not\nimprobable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,\nthat \u0002ne morning.\nFather, said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to\nkeep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: what's\na Resurrection-Man?\nMr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered,\nHow should I know?\nI thought you knowed everything, father, said the artless boy.\nHem! Well, returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting\noff his hat to give his spikes free play, he's a tradesman.\nWhat's his goods, father? asked the brisk Young Jerry.\nHis goods, said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind,\nis a branch of Scienti\u0002c goods.\nPersons' bodies, ain't it, father? asked the lively boy.\nI believe it is something of that sort, said Mr. Cruncher.\nOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm\nquite growed up!\nMr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and\nmoral way. It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be care-\nful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can\nhelp to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may\nnot come to be \u0002t for. As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a\nfew yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr.\nCruncher added to himself: Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes\nwot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for\nhis mother!", "index": 19}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 15, "chapter_title": "Knitting", "chapter_text": "There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur\nDefarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\nthrough its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending\nover measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the\nbest of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine\nthat he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its\nin\u0003uence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.\nNo vivacious Bacchanalian \u0003ame leaped out of the pressed grape of\nMonsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering \u0002re that burnt in the dark, lay\nhidden in the dregs of it.\nThis had been the third morning in succession, on which there had\nbeen early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\non Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of\nearly brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered\nand slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who\ncould not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.\nThese were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could\nhave commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to\nseat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with\ngreedy looks.\nNotwithstanding an unusual \u0003ow of company, the master of the\nwine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed\nthe threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered\nto see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution\nof wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much de-\nfaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of\nhumanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\nA suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\nobserved by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in\nat every place, high and low, from the kings palace to the criminal's gaol.\nGames at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers\nwith them, drinkers drew \u0002gures on the tables with spilt drops of wine,\nMadame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her\ntoothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long\nway off.\nThus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It\nwas high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and\nunder his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the\nother a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two\nentered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of \u0002re in the\nbreast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred\nand \u0003ickered in \u0003ames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one\nhad followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop,\nthough the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.\nGood day, gentlemen! said Monsieur Defarge.\nIt may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited\nan answering chorus of Good day!\nIt is bad weather, gentlemen, said Defarge, shaking his head.\nUpon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast\ndown their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went\nout.\nMy wife, said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: I\nhave travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\nJacques. I met himby accidenta day and half's journey out of Paris.\nHe is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to\ndrink, my wife!\nA second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine\nbefore the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to\nthe company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some\ncoarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and\ndrinking near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went\nout.\nDefarge refreshed himself with a draught of winebut, he took less\nthan was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no\nrarityand stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.\nHe looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even\nMadame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.\nHave you \u0002nished your repast, friend? he asked, in due season.\nYes, thank you.\nCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could\noccupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\nOut of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a court-\nyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into\na garret,formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low\nbench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\nNo white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there\nwho had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the\nwhite-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once\nlooked in at him through the chinks in the wall.\nDefarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\nJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness en-\ncountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\nSpeak, Jacques Five!\nThe mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead\nwith it, and said, Where shall I commence, monsieur?\nCommence, was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, at\nthe commencement.\nI saw him then, messieurs, began the mender of roads, a year ago\nthis running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging\nby the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road,\nthe sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the\nhill, he hanging by the chainlike this.\nAgain the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in\nwhich he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been\nthe infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village dur-\ning a whole year.\nJacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?\nNever, answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicu-\nlar.\nJacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\nBy his tall \u0002gure, said the mender of roads, softly, and with his\n\u0002nger at his nose. When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,\n'Say, what is he like?' I make response, `Tall as a spectre.' \nYou should have said, short as a dwarf, returned Jacques Two.\nBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither\ndid he con\u0002de in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do\nnot offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his\n\u0002nger, standing near our little fountain, and says, `To me! Bring that\nrascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\nHe is right there, Jacques, murmured Defarge, to him who had\ninterrupted. Go on!\nGood! said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. The tall\nman is lost, and he is soughthow many months? Nine, ten, eleven?\nNo matter, the number, said Defarge. He is well hidden, but at\nlast he is unluckily found. Go on!\nI am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about\nto go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down\nin the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and\nsee coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man\nwith his arms boundtied to his sideslike this!\nWith the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\nelbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.\nI stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers\nand their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle\nis well worth looking at), and at \u0002rst, as they approach, I see no more\nthan that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they\nare almost black to my sightexcept on the side of the sun going to\nbed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long\nshadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and\nare on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see\nthat they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as\nthey come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I\nrecognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well\ncontent to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the\nevening when he and I \u0002rst encountered, close to the same spot!\nHe described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it\nvividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\nI do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does\nnot show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know\nit, with our eyes. `Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing\nto the village, `bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster.\nI follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his\nwooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame,\nand consequently slow, they drive him with their gunslike this!\nHe imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the\nbutt-ends of muskets.\nAs they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\nlaugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with\ndust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring\nhim into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the\nmill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the\ndarkness of the night, and swallow himlike this!\nHe opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sound-\ning snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect\nby opening it again, Defarge said, Go on, Jacques.\nAll the village, pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a\nlow voice, withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the\nvillage sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the\nlocks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of\nit, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder,\neating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison,\non my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a\nlofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has\nno hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a\ndead man.\nDefarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of\nall of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the\ncountryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was\nauthoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and\nTwo sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand,\nand his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent,\non one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over\nthe network of \u0002ne nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing\nbetween them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of\nthe window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.\nGo on, Jacques, said Defarge.\nHe remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\nat him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance,\nat the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is\nachieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned\ntowards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-\nhouse; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the\nfountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed;\nthey say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he\nwas enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a\npetition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is\npossible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.\nListen then, Jacques, Number One of that name sternly inter-\nposed. Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen.\nAll here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the\nstreet, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who,\nat the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition\nin his hand.\nAnd once again listen, Jacques! said the kneeling Number Three:\nhis \u0002ngers ever wandering over and over those \u0002ne nerves, with a strik-\ningly greedy air, as if he hungered for somethingthat was neither food\nnor drink; the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and\nstruck him blows. You hear?\nI hear, messieurs.\nGo on then, said Defarge.\nAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain, resumed\nthe countryman, that he is brought down into our country to be ex-\necuted on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They\neven whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Mon-\nseigneur was the father of his tenantsserfswhat you willhe will be\nexecuted as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right\nhand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into\nwounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there\nwill be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; \u0002-\nnally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That\nold man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an at-\ntempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if\nhe lies? I am not a scholar.\nListen once again then, Jacques! said the man with the restless\nhand and the craving air. The name of that prisoner was Damiens,\nand it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris;\nand nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done,\nthan the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of ea-\nger attention to the lastto the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,\nwhen he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was\ndonewhy, how old are you?\nThirty-\u0002ve, said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.\nIt was done when you were more than ten years old; you might\nhave seen it.\nEnough! said Defarge, with grim impatience. Long live the\nDevil! Go on.\nWell! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing\nelse; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday\nnight when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from\nthe prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen\ndig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the\nfountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.\nThe mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling,\nand pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.\nAll work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,\nthe cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers\nhave marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many\nsoldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gagtied\nso, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed. He\nsuggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners\nof his mouth to his ears. On the top of the gallows is \u0002xed the knife,\nblade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet\nhighand is left hanging, poisoning the water.\nThey looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his\nface, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the\nspectacle.\nIt is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children\ndraw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under\nit, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was\ngoing to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across\nthe church, across the mill, across the prisonseemed to strike across\nthe earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!\nThe hungry man gnawed one of his \u0002ngers as he looked at the other\nthree, and his \u0002nger quivered with the craving that was on him.\nThat's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),\nand I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was\nwarned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and\nnow walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And\nhere you see me!\nAfter a gloomy silence, the \u0002rst Jacques said, Good! You have\nacted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the\ndoor?\nVery willingly, said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted\nto the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.\nThe three had risen, and their heads were together when he came\nback to the garret.\nHow say you, Jacques? demanded Number One. To be regis-\ntered?\nTo be registered, as doomed to destruction, returned Defarge.\nMagni\u0002cent! croaked the man with the craving.\nThe chateau, and all the race? inquired the \u0002rst.\nThe chateau and all the race, returned Defarge. Extermination.\nThe hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, Magni\u0002cent! and\nbegan gnawing another \u0002nger.\nAre you sure, asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, that no embar-\nrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without\ndoubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall\nwe always be able to decipher itor, I ought to say, will she?\nJacques, returned Defarge, drawing himself up, if madame my\nwife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not\nlose a word of itnot a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and\nher own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Con\u0002de in\nMadame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,\nto erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or\ncrimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.\nThere was a murmur of con\u0002dence and approval, and then the man\nwho hungered, asked: Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so.\nHe is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?\nHe knows nothing, said Defarge; at least nothing more than\nwould easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge\nmyself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set\nhim on his road. He wishes to see the \u0002ne worldthe King, the Queen,\nand Court; let him see them on Sunday.\nWhat? exclaimed the hungry man, staring. Is it a good sign, that\nhe wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?\nJacques, said Defarge; judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish\nher to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish\nhim to bring it down one day.\nNothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found al-\nready dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on\nthe pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was\nsoon asleep.\nWorse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been\nfound in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mys-\nterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life\nwas very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter,\nso expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to\nperceive that his being there had any connection with anything below\nthe surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted\non her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee\nwhat that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should\ntake it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen\nhim do a murder and afterwards \u0003ay the victim, she would infallibly go\nthrough with it until the play was played out.\nTherefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not en-\nchanted (though he said he was) to \u0002nd that madame was to accompany\nmonsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to\nhave madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\nadditionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the af-\nternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see\nthe carriage of the King and Queen.\nYou work hard, madame, said a man near her.\nYes, answered Madame Defarge; I have a good deal to do.\nWhat do you make, madame?\nMany things.\nFor instance\nFor instance, returned Madame Defarge, composedly, shrouds.\nThe man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the\nmender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily\nclose and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he\nwas fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced\nKing and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by\nthe shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\nladies and \u0002ne lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\nand elegantly spurning \u0002gures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\nsexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary in-\ntoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long\nlive everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous\nJacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, foun-\ntains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,more lords\nand ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sen-\ntiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours,\nhe had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and\nthroughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from\n\u0003ying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.\nBravo! said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over,\nlike a patron; you are a good boy!\nThe mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrust-\nful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.\nYou are the fellow we want, said Defarge, in his ear; you make\nthese fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more\ninsolent, and it is the nearer ended.\nHey! cried the mender of roads, re\u0003ectively; that's true.\nThese fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and\nwould stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather\nthan in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your\nbreath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot\ndeceive them too much.\nMadame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in\ncon\u0002rmation.\nAs to you, said she, you would shout and shed tears for anything,\nif it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\nTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.\nIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them\nto pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you\nwould pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?\nTruly yes, madame.\nYes. And if you were shown a \u0003ock of birds, unable to \u0003y, and were\nset upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,\nyou would set upon the birds of the \u0002nest feathers; would you not?\nIt is true, madame.\nYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day, said Madame Defarge,\nwith a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been\napparent; now, go home!", "index": 20}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 16, "chapter_title": "Still Knitting", "chapter_text": "Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the\nbosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the\ndarkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by\nthe wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where\nthe chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the\nwhispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for lis-\ntening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows\nwho, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn,\nstrayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase,\nhad it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces\nwas altered. A rumour just lived in the villagehad a faint and bare\nexistence there, as its people hadthat when the knife struck home, the\nfaces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that\nwhen that dangling \u0002gure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain,\nthey changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they\nwould henceforth bear for ever. In the stone face over the great win-\ndow of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two \u0002ne dints\nwere pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised,\nand which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when\ntwo or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried\npeep at Monsieur the Marquis petri\u0002ed, a skinny \u0002nger would not have\npointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss\nand leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could \u0002nd a living there.\nChateau and hut, stone face and dangling \u0002gure, the red stain on the\nstone \u0003oor, and the pure water in the village wellthousands of acres\nof landa whole province of Franceall France itselflay under the\nnight sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole\nworld, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.\nAnd as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the\nmanner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the\nfeeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice\nand virtue, of every responsible creature on it.\nThe Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,\nin their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey nat-\nurally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse,\nand the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination\nand inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the\nsoldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with,\nand affectionately embraced.\nWhen Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky\nwings, and they, having \u0002nally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were\npicking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets,\nMadame Defarge spoke to her husband:\nSay then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?\nVery little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commis-\nsioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say,\nbut he knows of one.\nEh well! said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\nbusiness air. It is necessary to register him. How do they call that\nman?\nHe is English.\nSo much the better. His name?\nBarsad, said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he\nhad been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect\ncorrectness.\nBarsad, repeated madame. Good. Christian name?\nJohn.\nJohn Barsad, repeated madame, after murmuring it once to her-\nself. Good. His appearance; is it known?\nAge, about forty years; height, about \u0002ve feet nine; black hair; com-\nplexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin,\nlong, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar incli-\nnation towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.\nEh my faith. It is a portrait! said madame, laughing. He shall be\nregistered to-morrow.\nThey turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was mid-\nnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her\ndesk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence,\nexamined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other\nentries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and\n\u0002nally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the\nbowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\nhandkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\nnight. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up\nand down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which con-\ndition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up\nand down through life.\nThe night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so\nfoul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory\nsense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much\nstronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy\nand aniseed. He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down\nhis smoked-out pipe.\nYou are fatigued, said madame, raising her glance as she knotted\nthe money. There are only the usual odours.\nI am a little tired, her husband acknowledged.\nYou are a little depressed, too, said madame, whose quick eyes\nhad never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two\nfor him. Oh, the men, the men!\nBut my dear! began Defarge.\nBut my dear! repeated madame, nodding \u0002rmly; but my dear!\nYou are faint of heart to-night, my dear!\nWell, then, said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\nbreast, it is a long time.\nIt is a long time, repeated his wife; and when is it not a long\ntime? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.\nIt does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning, said\nDefarge.\nHow long, demanded madame, composedly, does it take to\nmake and store the lightning? Tell me.\nDefarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in\nthat too.\nIt does not take a long time, said madame, for an earthquake\nto swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the\nearthquake?\nA long time, I suppose, said Defarge.\nBut when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\nbefore it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen\nor heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.\nShe tied a knot with \u0003ashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\nI tell thee, said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,\nthat although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and com-\ning. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always\nadvancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we\nknow, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the\nrage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more\nand more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock\nyou.\nMy brave wife, returned Defarge, standing before her with his\nhead a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\nattentive pupil before his catechist, I do not question all this. But it\nhas lasted a long time, and it is possibleyou know well, my wife, it is\npossiblethat it may not come, during our lives.\nEh well! How then? demanded madame, tying another knot, as\nif there were another enemy strangled.\nWell! said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic\nshrug. We shall not see the triumph.\nWe shall have helped it, returned madame, with her extended\nhand in strong action. Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe,\nwith all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if\nI knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and\nstill I would\nThen madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\nHold! cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\ncowardice; I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.\nYes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your\nvictim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without\nthat. When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for\nthe time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always\nready.\nMadame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by strik-\ning her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its\nbrains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in\na serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\nNext noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\nwine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\nnow and then glanced at the \u0003ower, it was with no infraction of her\nusual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\ndrinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\nand heaps of \u0003ies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\nperquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead\nat the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other \u0003ies\nout promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\nthemselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\nthe same fate. Curious to consider how heedless \u0003ies are!perhaps they\nthought as much at Court that sunny summer day.\nA \u0002gure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge\nwhich she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began\nto pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the \u0002gure.\nIt was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\ncustomers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-\nshop.\nGood day, madame, said the new-comer.\nGood day, monsieur.\nShe said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:\nHah! Good day, age about forty, height about \u0002ve feet nine, black hair,\ngenerally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin,\nlong and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar\ninclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!\nGood day, one and all!\nHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\nmouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\nMadame complied with a polite air.\nMarvellous cognac this, madame!\nIt was the \u0002rst time it had ever been so complemented, and Madame\nDefarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, how-\never, that the cognac was \u0003attered, and took up her knitting. The visitor\nwatched her \u0002ngers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of\nobserving the place in general.\nYou knit with great skill, madame.\nI am accustomed to it.\nA pretty pattern too!\nYou think so? said madame, looking at him with a smile.\nDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\nPastime, said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her\n\u0002ngers moved nimbly.\nNot for use?\nThat depends. I may \u0002nd a use for it one day. If I doWell, said\nmadame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\ncoquetry, I'll use it!\nIt was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be de-\ncidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\nmen had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\ncatching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking\nabout as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of\nthose who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.\nThey had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been\nable to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken,\npurposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.\nJohn, thought madame, checking off her work as her \u0002ngers knit-\nted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. Stay long enough, and I shall\nknit `Barsad' before you go.\nYou have a husband, madame?\nI have.\nChildren?\nNo children.\nBusiness seems bad?\nBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.\nAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, tooas you\nsay.\nAs you say, madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting\nan extra something into his name that boded him no good.\nPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think\nso. Of course.\nI think? returned madame, in a high voice. I and my husband\nhave enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All\nwe think, here, is how to live. That is the subject we think of, and it\ngives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embar-\nrassing our heads concerning others. I think for others? No, no.\nThe spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could \u0002nd or make,\ndid not allow his baf\u0003ed state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\nstood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\nDefarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.\nA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the\npoor Gaspard! With a sigh of great compassion.\nMy faith! returned madame, coolly and lightly, if people use\nknives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand\nwhat the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\nI believe, said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that in-\nvited con\u0002dence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility\nin every muscle of his wicked face: I believe there is much compassion\nand anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between\nourselves.\nIs there? asked madame, vacantly.\nIs there not?\nHere is my husband! said Madame Defarge.\nAs the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\nhim by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, Good\nday, Jacques! Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\nGood day, Jacques! the spy repeated; with not quite so much\ncon\u0002dence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.\nYou deceive yourself, monsieur, returned the keeper of the wine-\nshop. You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest\nDefarge.\nIt is all the same, said the spy, airily, but discom\u0002ted too: good\nday!\nGood day! answered Defarge, drily.\nI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting\nwhen you entered, that they tell me there isand no wonder!much\nsympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor\nGaspard.\nNo one has told me so, said Defarge, shaking his head. I know\nnothing of it.\nHaving said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with\nhis hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at\nthe person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them\nwould have shot with the greatest satisfaction.\nThe spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\nattitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water,\nand asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out\nfor him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.\nYou seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I\ndo? observed Defarge.\nNot at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly inter-\nested in its miserable inhabitants.\nHah! muttered Defarge.\nThe pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls\nto me, pursued the spy, that I have the honour of cherishing some\ninteresting associations with your name.\nIndeed! said Defarge, with much indifference.\nYes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old do-\nmestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You\nsee I am informed of the circumstances?\nSuch is the fact, certainly, said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\nto him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and\nwarbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\nIt was to you, said the spy, that his daughter came; and it was\nfrom your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat\nbrown monsieur; how is he called?in a little wigLorryof the bank\nof Tellson and Companyover to England.\nSuch is the fact, repeated Defarge.\nVery interesting remembrances! said the spy. I have known Doc-\ntor Manette and his daughter, in England.\nYes? said Defarge.\nYou don't hear much about them now? said the spy.\nNo, said Defarge.\nIn effect, madame struck in, looking up from her work and her\nlittle song, we never hear about them. We received the news of their\nsafe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\nthey have gradually taken their road in lifewe, oursand we have\nheld no correspondence.\nPerfectly so, madame, replied the spy. She is going to be mar-\nried.\nGoing? echoed madame. She was pretty enough to have been\nmarried long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\nOh! You know I am English.\nI perceive your tongue is, returned madame; and what the\ntongue is, I suppose the man is.\nHe did not take the identi\u0002cation as a compliment; but he made the\nbest of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\nend, he added:\nYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an English-\nman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gas-\npard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that\nshe is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom\nGaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the\npresent Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis\nthere; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's\nfamily.\nMadame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\neffect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\nas to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled,\nand his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if\nhe had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\nHaving made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\nworth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\npaid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to\nsay, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward\nto the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For\nsome minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint\nAntoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them,\nlest he should come back.\nCan it be true, said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his\nwife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: what\nhe has said of Ma'amselle Manette?\nAs he has said it, returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little,\nit is probably false. But it may be true.\nIf it is Defarge began, and stopped.\nIf it is? repeated his wife.\nAnd if it does come, while we live to see it triumphI hope, for\nher sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.\nHer husband's destiny, said Madame Defarge, with her usual com-\nposure, will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end\nthat is to end him. That is all I know.\nBut it is very strangenow, at least, is it not very strangesaid\nDefarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, that,\nafter all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her hus-\nband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by\nthe side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?\nStranger things than that will happen when it does come, an-\nswered madame. I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are\nboth here for their merits; that is enough.\nShe roiled up her knitting when she had said those words, and\npresently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about\nher head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objec-\ntionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for\nits disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very\nshortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.\nIn the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned\nhimself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came\nto the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame\nDefarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place\nto place and from group to group: a Missionarythere were many like\nhersuch as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women\nknitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a\nmechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the\njaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony \u0002ngers had been still, the\nstomachs would have been more famine-pinched.\nBut, as the \u0002ngers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as\nMadame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker\nand \u0002ercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with,\nand left behind.\nHer husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.\nA great woman, said he, a strong woman, a grand woman, a fright-\nfully grand woman!\nDarkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells\nand the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard,\nas the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. An-\nother darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ring-\ning pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted\ninto thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to\ndrown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and\nPlenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women\nwho sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in\naround a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,\ncounting dropping heads.", "index": 21}

She had employed herself in\nboth ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this\ntime was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.\nAnd I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in\nthe love that Heaven has so blessedmy love for Charles, and Charles's\nlove for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or\nif my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the\nlength of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-\nreproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is\nEven as it was, she could not command her voice.\nIn the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face\nupon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of\nthe sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and its\ngoing.\nDearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,\nquite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will\never interpose between us? I know it well, but do you know it? In your\nown heart, do you feel quite certain?\nHer father answered, with a cheerful \u0002rmness of conviction he could\nscarcely have assumed, Quite sure, my darling! More than that, he\nadded, as he tenderly kissed her: my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen\nthrough your marriage, than it could have beennay, than it ever was\nwithout it.\nIf I could hope that, my father!\nBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how\nplain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, can-\nnot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be\nwasted\nShe moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and\nrepeated the word.\nwasted, my childshould not be wasted, struck aside from the\nnatural order of thingsfor my sake. Your unsel\u0002shness cannot entirely\ncomprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask your-\nself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\nIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite\nhappy with you.\nHe smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been\nunhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:\nMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been\nCharles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I\nshould have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would\nhave cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\nIt was the \u0002rst time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him\nrefer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sen-\nsation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long\nafterwards.\nSee! said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the\nmoon. I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not\nbear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to\nme to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my\nhead against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dun and\nlethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal\nlines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular\nlines with which I could intersect them. He added in his inward and\npondering manner, as he looked at the moon, It was twenty either way,\nI remember, and the twentieth was dif\u0002cult to squeeze in.\nThe strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\ndeepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\nthe manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present\ncheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.\nI have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the un-\nborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it\nhad been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether\nit was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a\ntime in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbear-\nable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his father's story;\nwho might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disap-\npeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would\ngrow to be a woman.\nShe drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.\nI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\nmerather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\ncast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to\na man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\nthe remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was\na blank.\nMy father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter\nwho never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\nYou, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have\nbrought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and\nthe moon on this last night.What did I say just now?\nShe knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\nSo! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the si-\nlence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with some-\nthing as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain\nfor its foundations couldI have imagined her as coming to me in my\ncell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have\nseen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I\nnever held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window\nand the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am\nspeaking of?\nThe \u0002gure was not; thetheimage; the fancy?\nNo. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense\nof sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was\nanother and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no\nmore than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness\ntooas you havebut was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie?\nHardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to\nunderstand these perplexed distinctions.\nHis collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from\nrunning cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.\nIn that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,\ncoming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her\nmarried life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My\npicture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\ncheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\nI was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\nthat was I.\nAnd she showed me her children, said the Doctor of Beauvais,\nand they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they\npassed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and\nlooked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver\nme; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such\nthings. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees,\nand blessed her.\nI am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you\nbless me as fervently to-morrow?\nLucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night\nfor loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my\ngreat happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near\nthe happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.\nHe embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly\nthanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they\nwent into the house.\nThere was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was\neven to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was\nto make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to\nextend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging\nto the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\nDoctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were\nonly three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that\nCharles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the\nloving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\nSo, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they sepa-\nrated. But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came\ndownstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,\nbeforehand.\nAll things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\nasleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his\nhands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the\nshadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then,\nleaned over him, and looked at him.\nInto his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but,\nhe covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held\nthe mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its\nquiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not\nto be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\nShe timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer\nthat she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as\nhis sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips\nonce more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of\nthe leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips\nhad moved in praying for him.", "index": 22}

They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry,\nand Miss Prossto whom the event, through a gradual process of rec-\noncilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but\nfor the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have\nbeen the bridegroom.\nAnd so, said Mr. Lorry, who could not suf\u0002ciently admire the\nbride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of\nher quiet, pretty dress; and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I\nbrought you across the Channel, such a baby' Lord bless me' How little\nI thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was\nconferring on my friend Mr. Charles!\nYou didn't mean it, remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, and\ntherefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\nReally? Well; but don't cry, said the gentle Mr. Lorry.\nI am not crying, said Miss Pross; you are.\nI, my Pross? (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with\nher, on occasion.)\nYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such\na present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into\nanybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection, said\nMiss Pross, that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I\ncouldn't see it.\nI am highly grati\u0002ed, said Mr. Lorry, though, upon my honour,\nI had no intention of rendering those tri\u0003ing articles of remembrance\ninvisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\nspeculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might\nhave been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these \u0002fty years almost!\nNot at all! From Miss Pross.\nYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry? asked the\ngentleman of that name.\nPooh! rejoined Miss Pross; you were a bachelor in your cradle.\nWell! observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, that\nseems probable, too.\nAnd you were cut out for a bachelor, pursued Miss Pross, before\nyou were put in your cradle.\nThen, I think, said Mr. Lorry, that I was very unhandsomely\ndealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my\npattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie, drawing his arm soothingly\nround her waist, I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross\nand I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the \u0002nal\nopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You\nleave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as\nyour own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\nfortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's\nshall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\nthe fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband,\non your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent\nhim to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear\nSomebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an\nold-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his\nown.\nFor a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-\nremembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden\nhair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy\nwhich, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\nThe door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with\nCharles Darnay. He was so deadly palewhich had not been the case\nwhen they went in togetherthat no vestige of colour was to be seen in\nhis face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except\nthat to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indi-\ncation that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over\nhim, like a cold wind.\nHe gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the\nchariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest fol-\nlowed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where\nno strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were\nhappily married.\nBesides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little\ngroup when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\nglanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark\nobscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to break-\nfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had min-\ngled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were\nmingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of\nthe door at parting.\nIt was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\ncheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfold-\ning arms, Take her, Charles! She is yours!\nAnd her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and\nshe was gone.\nThe corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\npreparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\nand Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\nthe welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\nchange to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there,\nhad struck him a poisoned blow.\nHe had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have\nbeen expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But,\nit was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through\nhis absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away\ninto his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of\nDefarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\nI think, he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration,\nI think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\nI must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back\npresently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there,\nand all will be well.\nIt was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out\nof Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he as-\ncended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant;\ngoing thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of\nknocking.\nGood God! he said, with a start. What's that?\nMiss Pross, with a terri\u0002ed face, was at his ear. O me, O me! All is\nlost! cried she, wringing her hands. What is to be told to Ladybird?\nHe doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\nMr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\nDoctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\nwhen he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was\nbent down, and he was very busy.\nDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\nThe Doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly, half as if\nhe were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again.\nHe had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\nthroat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old hag-\ngard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard\nimpatientlyas if in some sense of having been interrupted.\nMr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was\na shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\nhim, and asked what it was.\nA young lady's walking shoe, he muttered, without looking up.\nIt ought to have been \u0002nished long ago. Let it be.\nBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\nHe obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without\npausing in his work.\nYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your\nproper occupation. Think, dear friend!\nNothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an\ninstant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion\nwould extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked,\nin silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echo-\nless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could dis-\ncover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.\nIn that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas\nthough he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\nTwo things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important\nabove all others; the \u0002rst, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the\nsecond, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In con-\njunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\nprecaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required\na few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be prac-\ntised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having\nbeen called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\ntwo or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\naddressed to her by the same post.\nThese measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\nthe hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\nanother course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\nthought the best, on the Doctor's case.\nIn the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being\nthereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him atten-\ntively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore\nmade arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the \u0002rst time in\nhis life, and took his post by the window in the same room.\nHe was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to\nspeak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He aban-\ndoned that attempt on the \u0002rst day, and resolved merely to keep himself\nalways before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he\nhad fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\nwindow, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\nnatural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\nDoctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and\nworked on, that \u0002rst day, until it was too dark to seeworked on, half\nan hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or\nwrite. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry\nrose and said to him:\nWill you go out?\nHe looked down at the \u0003oor on either side of him in the old manner,\nlooked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\nOut?\nYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\nHe made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But,\nMr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the\ndusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he\nwas in some misty way asking himself, Why not? The sagacity of the\nman of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold\nit.\nMiss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed\nhim at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a\nlong time before he lay down; but, when he did \u0002nally lay himself down,\nhe fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to\nhis bench and to work.\nOn this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\nand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He re-\nturned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that\nhe thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to\nhave Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those\ntimes, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, pre-\ncisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was\ndone without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or\noften enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart\nto believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred\nby some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.\nWhen it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\nDear Doctor, will you go out?\nAs before, he repeated, Out?\nYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\nThis time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no\nanswer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In\nthe meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and\nhad sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return,\nbe slipped away to his bench.\nThe time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and\nhis heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every\nday. The third day came and went, the fourth, the \u0002fth. Five days, six\ndays, seven days, eight days, nine days.\nWith a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heav-\nier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret\nwas well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not\nfail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out\nat \u0002rst, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so\nintent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and\nexpert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.", "index": 23}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 19, "chapter_title": "An Opinion", "chapter_text": "Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\ntenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\ninto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was\ndark night.\nHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he\nhad done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door\nof the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's\nbench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat\nreading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face\n(which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\nstudious and attentive.\nEven when he had satis\u0002ed himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking\nmight not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show\nhim his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and\nemployed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the\nchange of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\nIt was but the inquiry of his \u0002rst confusion and astonishment, the\nanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\ncorresponding and suf\u0002cient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\nHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\nManette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\nDoctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\nWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If\nhe had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He ad-\nvised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour,\nand should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If\nhe appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then\ncautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he\nhad been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\nMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was\nworked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual me-\nthodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in\nhis usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was sum-\nmoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.\nSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping\nthose delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the\nonly safe advance, he at \u0002rst supposed that his daughter's marriage had\ntaken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out,\nto the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\ncounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\nhe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the\naid he sought. And that aid was his own.\nTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he\nand the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\nMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in con\u0002-\ndence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to\nsay, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may\nbe less so.\nGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work,\nthe Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already\nglanced at his hands more than once.\nDoctor Manette, said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on\nthe arm, the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sakeand above all, for\nhis daughter'shis daughter's, my dear Manette.\nIf I understand, said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, some mental\nshock?\nYes!\nBe explicit, said the Doctor. Spare no detail.\nMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\nMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of\ngreat acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, thetheas\nyou express itthe mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock under\nwhich the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, be-\ncause I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no\nother means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the\nsufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himselfas I once\nheard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock\nfrom which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelli-\ngent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of\nbody, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowl-\nedge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,\nhe paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse.\nThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, Of how long duration?\nNine days and nights.\nHow did it show itself? I infer, glancing at his hands again, in\nthe resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\nThat is the fact.\nNow, did you ever see him, asked the Doctor, distinctly and col-\nlectedly, though in the same low voice, engaged in that pursuit origi-\nnally?\nOnce.\nAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respectsor in\nall respectsas he was then?\nI think in all respects.\nYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the re-\nlapse?\nNo. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from\nher. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\nThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, That was very kind.\nThat was very thoughtful! Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and\nneither of the two spoke for a little while.\nNow, my dear Manette, said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, I am a mere man of business,\nand un\u0002t to cope with such intricate and dif\u0002cult matters. I do not\npossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\nintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\nI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\nrelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of\nit be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does\nit come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can\nhave been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve\nmine, if I knew how.\nBut I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\nknowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might\nbe able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\nPray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\nand teach me how to be a little more useful.\nDoctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spo-\nken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.\nI think it probable, said the Doctor, breaking silence with an ef-\nfort, that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\nunforeseen by its subject.\nWas it dreaded by him? Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\nVery much. He said it with an involuntary shudder.\nYou have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the suf-\nferer's mind, and how dif\u0002culthow almost impossibleit is, for him\nto force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.\nWould he, asked Mr. Lorry, be sensibly relieved if he could pre-\nvail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is\non him?\nI think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\nbelieve itin some casesto be quite impossible.\nNow, said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm\nagain, after a short silence on both sides, to what would you refer this\nattack?\nI believe, returned Doctor Manette, that there had been a strong\nand extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\nwas the \u0002rst cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\ndistressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there\nhad long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would\nbe recalledsay, under certain circumstancessay, on a particular occa-\nsion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare\nhimself made him less able to bear it.\nWould he remember what took place in the relapse? asked Mr.\nLorry, with natural hesitation.\nThe Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\nanswered, in a low voice, Not at all.\nNow, as to the future, hinted Mr. Lorry.\nAs to the future, said the Doctor, recovering \u0002rmness, I should\nhave great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so\nsoon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a\ncomplicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and\ncontended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed,\nI should hope that the worst was over.\nWell, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful! said Mr. Lorry.\nI am thankful! repeated the Doctor, bending his head with rever-\nence.\nThere are two other points, said Mr. Lorry, on which I am anx-\nious to be instructed. I may go on?\nYou cannot do your friend a better service. The Doctor gave him\nhis hand.\nTo the \u0002rst, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\nhe applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\nknowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now,\ndoes he do too much?\nI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\nsingular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part,\nthe result of af\u0003iction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the\nmore it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He\nmay have observed himself, and made the discovery.\nYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\nI think I am quite sure of it.\nMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now\nMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\nviolent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\nExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a mo-\nment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of\nthis disorder?\nI do not think so. I do not think, said Doctor Manette with the\n\u0002rmness of self-conviction, that anything but the one train of associa-\ntion would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraor-\ndinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has happened,\nand after his recovery, I \u0002nd it dif\u0002cult to imagine any such violent\nsounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost believe, that the\ncircumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\nHe spoke with the dif\u0002dence of a man who knew how slight a thing\nwould overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\ncon\u0002dence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\nendurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that con\u0002dence.\nHe professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was,\nand approached his second and last point. He felt it to be the most\ndif\u0002cult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation\nwith Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine\ndays, he knew that he must face it.\nThe occupation resumed under the in\u0003uence of this passing af\u0003ic-\ntion so happily recovered from, said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, we\nwill callBlacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a\ncase and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\ntime, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly\nfound at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?\nThe Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\nnervously on the ground.\nHe has always kept it by him, said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious\nlook at his friend. Now, would it not be better that he should let it\ngo?\nStill, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on\nthe ground.\nYou do not \u0002nd it easy to advise me? said Mr. Lorry. I quite\nunderstand it to be a nice question. And yet I think And there he\nshook his head, and stopped.\nYou see, said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy\npause, it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\nof this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupa-\ntion, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain\nso much, by substituting the perplexity of the \u0002ngers for the perplexity\nof the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the inge-\nnuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has\nnever been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.\nEven now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever\nbeen, and even speaks of himself with a kind of con\u0002dence, the idea that\nhe might need that old employment, and not \u0002nd it, gives him a sudden\nsense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a\nlost child.\nHe looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's\nface.\nBut may notmind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of\nbusiness who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings,\nand bank-notesmay not the retention of the thing involve the reten-\ntion of the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not\nthe fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to\nkeep the forge?\nThere was another silence.\nYou see, too, said the Doctor, tremulously, it is such an old com-\npanion.\nI would not keep it, said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he\ngained in \u0002rmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. I would recom-\nmend him to sacri\u0002ce it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does\nno good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his\ndaughter's sake, my dear Manette!\nVery strange to see what a struggle there was within him!\nIn her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not\ntake it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not\nthere; let him miss his old companion after an absence.\nMr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.\nThey passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.\nOn the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the four-\nteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution\nthat had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously\nexplained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and\nshe had no suspicions.\nOn the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went\ninto his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by\nMiss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a myste-\nrious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to\npieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a\nmurderfor which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable \u0002g-\nure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient\nfor the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen \u0002re; and\nthe tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do\ndestruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and\nMiss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the\nremoval of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices\nin a horrible crime.", "index": 24}

They had not been at\nhome many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved\nin habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged\nair of \u0002delity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles\nDarnay.\nHe watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window,\nand of speaking to him when no one overheard.\nMr. Darnay, said Carton, I wish we might be friends.\nWe are already friends, I hope.\nYou are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't\nmean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be\nfriends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.\nCharles Darnayas was naturalasked him, in all good-humour\nand good-fellowship, what he did mean?\nUpon my life, said Carton, smiling, I \u0002nd that easier to com-\nprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me\ntry. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk\nthanthan usual?\nI remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to con-\nfess that you had been drinking.\nI remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me,\nfor I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one\nday, when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not\ngoing to preach.\nI am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarm-\ning to me.\nAh! said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved\nthat away. On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number,\nas you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I\nwish you would forget it.\nI forgot it long ago.\nFashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy\nto me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,\nand a light answer does not help me to forget it.\nIf it was a light answer, returned Darnay, I beg your forgiveness\nfor it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my\nsurprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the\nfaith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good\nHeaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important\nto remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?\nAs to the great service, said Carton, I am bound to avow to you,\nwhen you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap,\nI don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.\nMind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.\nYou make light of the obligation, returned Darnay, but I will not\nquarrel with your light answer.\nGenuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my\npurpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me;\nyou know I am incapable of all the higher and better \u0003ights of men. If\nyou doubt it, ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so.\nI prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.\nWell! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never\ndone any good, and never will.\nI don't know that you `never will.' \nBut I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could\nendure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent\nreputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might\nbe permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might\nbe regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the re-\nsemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of\nfurniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt\nif I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail\nmyself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know\nthat I had it.\nWill you try?\nThat is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I\nhave indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your\nname?\nI think so, Carton, by this time.\nThey shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a\nminute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial\nas ever.\nWhen he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss\nPross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention\nof this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a\nproblem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not\nbitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who\nsaw him as he showed himself.\nHe had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young\nwife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found\nher waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly\nmarked.\nWe are thoughtful to-night! said Darnay, drawing his arm about\nher.\nYes, dearest Charles, with her hands on his breast, and the inquir-\ning and attentive expression \u0002xed upon him; we are rather thoughtful\nto-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.\nWhat is it, my Lucie?\nWill you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not\nto ask it?\nWill I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?\nWhat, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the\ncheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!\nI think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and\nrespect than you expressed for him to-night.\nIndeed, my own? Why so?\nThat is what you are not to ask me. But I thinkI knowhe\ndoes.\nIf you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my\nLife?\nI would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and\nvery lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe\nthat he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep\nwounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.\nIt is a painful re\u0003ection to me, said Charles Darnay, quite as-\ntounded, that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought\nthis of him.\nMy husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is\nscarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable\nnow. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even\nmagnanimous things.\nShe looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,\nthat her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.\nAnd, O my dearest Love! she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying\nher head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, remember how\nstrong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!\nThe supplication touched him home. I will always remember it,\ndear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.\nHe bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and\nfolded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark\nstreets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen\nthe drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes\nso loving of that husband, he might have cried to the nightand the\nwords would not have parted from his lips for the \u0002rst time\nGod bless her for her sweet compassion!", "index": 25}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 21, "chapter_title": "Echoing Footsteps", "chapter_text": "A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where\nthe Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound\nher husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and\ncompanion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the\ntranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.\nAt \u0002rst, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young\nwife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes\nwould be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes,\nsomething light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart\ntoo much. Fluttering hopes and doubtshopes, of a love as yet un-\nknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new\ndelightdivided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise\nthe sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the hus-\nband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so\nmuch, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.\nThat time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then,\namong the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the\nsound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would,\nthe young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.\nThey came, and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and\nthe Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had con\u0002ded\nhers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old,\nand made it a sacred joy to her.\nEver busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,\nweaving the service of her happy in\u0003uence through the tissue of all their\nlives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of\nyears none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's step was\nstrong and prosperous among them; her father's \u0002rm and equal. Lo,\nMiss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly\ncharger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-\ntree in the garden!\nEven when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were\nnot harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo\non a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a\nradiant smile, Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you\nboth, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!\nthose were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek,\nas the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.\nSuffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father,\nblessed words!\nThus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other\nechoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath\nof Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb\nwere mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a\nhushed murmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a\nsandy shoreas the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the\nmorning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the\ntongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.\nThe Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton.\nSome half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of com-\ning in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he\nhad once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one\nother thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been\nwhispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.\nNo man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with\na blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a\nmother, but her children had a strange sympathy with himan instinc-\ntive delicacy of pity for him. What \u0002ne hidden sensibilities are touched\nin such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was\nthe \u0002rst stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he\nkept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him,\nalmost at the last. Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!\nMr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great\nengine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend\nin his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually\nin a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped\nlife of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and\nstronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made\nit the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his\nstate of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of\nrising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a \u0003orid widow with\nproperty and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about\nthem but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.\nThese three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the\nmost offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like\nthree sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to\nLucie's husband: delicately saying Halloa! here are three lumps of\nbread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay! The po-\nlite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated\nMr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account\nin the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of\nthe pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of\ndeclaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs.\nDarnay had once put in practice to catch him, and on the diamond-\ncut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him not to\nbe caught. Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally\nparties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by\nsaying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himselfwhich is\nsurely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as\nto justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired\nspot, and there hanged out of the way.\nThese were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive,\nsometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until\nher little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes\nof her child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always\nactive and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not\nbe told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by\nherself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant\nthan any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about\nher, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he\nfound her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single,\nand of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and\nduties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked\nher What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to\nall of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried,\nor to have too much to do?\nBut, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menac-\ningly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about\nlittle Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as\nof a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.\nOn a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine,\nMr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie\nand her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they\nwere all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked\nat the lightning from the same place.\nI began to think, said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back,\nthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full\nof business all day, that we have not known what to do \u0002rst, or which\nway to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually\na run of con\u0002dence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be\nable to con\u0002de their property to us fast enough. There is positively a\nmania among some of them for sending it to England.\nThat has a bad look, said Darnay\nA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know\nwhat reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us\nat Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the\nordinary course without due occasion.\nStill, said Darnay, you know how gloomy and threatening the\nsky is.\nI know that, to be sure, assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade\nhimself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, but I\nam determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is\nManette?\nHere he is, said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.\nI am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings\nby which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous\nwithout reason. You are not going out, I hope?\nNo; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like, said\nthe Doctor.\nI don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not \u0002t to be\npitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't\nsee.\nOf course, it has been kept for you.\nThank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?\nAnd sleeping soundly.\nThat's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should\nbe otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put\nout all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank\nye. Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and\nhear the echoes about which you have your theory.\nNot a theory; it was a fancy.\nA fancy, then, my wise pet, said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand.\nThey are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only\nhear them!\nHeadlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into\nanybody's life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red,\nthe footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in\nthe dark London window.\nSaint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scare-\ncrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the bil-\nlowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremen-\ndous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked\narms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter\nwind: all the \u0002ngers convulsively clutching at every weapon or sem-\nblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no\nmatter how far off.\nWho gave them out, whence they last came, where they began,\nthrough what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a\ntime, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the\nthrong could have told; but, muskets were being distributedso were\ncartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes,\nevery weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People\nwho could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands\nto force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and\nheart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.\nEvery living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented\nwith a passionate readiness to sacri\u0002ce it.\nAs a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging\ncircled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron\nhad a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,\nalready begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,\nthrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm\nanother, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.\nKeep near to me, Jacques Three, cried Defarge; and do you,\nJacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as\nmany of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?\nEh, well! Here you see me! said madame, composed as ever, but\nnot knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with\nan axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a\npistol and a cruel knife.\nWhere do you go, my wife?\nI go, said madame, with you at present. You shall see me at the\nhead of women, by-and-bye.\nCome, then! cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. Patriots and\nfriends, we are ready! The Bastille!\nWith a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been\nshaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth\non depth, and over\u0003owed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing,\ndrums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the\nattack began.\nDeep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\ntowers, cannon, muskets, \u0002re and smoke. Through the \u0002re and through\nthe smokein the \u0002re and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against\na cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonierDefarge of the\nwine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two \u0002erce hours.\nDeep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great tow-\ners, cannon, muskets, \u0002re and smoke. One drawbridge down! Work,\ncomrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One\nThousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand;\nin the name of all the Angels or the Devilswhich you preferwork!\nThus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown\nhot.\nTo me, women! cried madame his wife. What! We can kill as\nwell as the men when the place is taken! And to her, with a shrill thirsty\ncry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and\nrevenge.\nCannon, muskets, \u0002re and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single\ndrawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight\ndisplacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flash-\ning weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard\nwork at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, exe-\ncrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious\nsounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single draw-\nbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still\nDefarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of\nFour \u0002erce hours.\nA white \u0003ag from within the fortress, and a parleythis dimly per-\nceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in itsuddenly the\nsea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-\nshop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls,\nin among the eight great towers surrendered!\nSo resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even\nto draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had\nbeen struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the\nouter courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he\nmade a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his\nside; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible\nin the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was\ntumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding\nnoise, yet furious dumb-show.\nThe Prisoners!\nThe Records!\nThe secret cells!\nThe instruments of torture!\nThe Prisoners!\nOf all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, The Prisoners!\nwas the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were\nan eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost\nbillows rolled past, bearing the prison of\u0002cers with them, and threaten-\ning them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed,\nDefarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these mena man\nwith a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his handseparated him\nfrom the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.\nShow me the North Tower! said Defarge. Quick!\nI will faithfully, replied the man, if you will come with me. But\nthere is no one there.\nWhat is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?\nasked Defarge. Quick!\nThe meaning, monsieur?\nDoes it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean\nthat I shall strike you dead?\nKill him! croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.\nMonsieur, it is a cell.\nShow it me!\nPass this way, then.\nJacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disap-\npointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise\nbloodshed, held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. Their\nthree heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it\nhad been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so\ntremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the\nFortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.\nAll around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from\nwhich, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped\ninto the air like spray.\nThrough gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past\nhideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous \u0003ights of steps,\nand again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry wa-\nterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked\nhand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and there,\nespecially at \u0002rst, the inundation started on them and swept by; but\nwhen they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a\ntower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of\nwalls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only\naudible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they\nhad come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.\nThe turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock,\nswung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and\npassed in:\nOne hundred and \u0002ve, North Tower!\nThere was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,\nwith a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stoop-\ning low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred\nacross, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes\non the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There\nwere the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.\nPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them, said\nDefarge to the turnkey.\nThe man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his\neyes.\nStop!Look here, Jacques!\nA. M.! croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.\nAlexandre Manette, said Defarge in his ear, following the let-\nters with his swart fore\u0002nger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. And\nhere he wrote `a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who\nscratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crow-\nbar? Give it me!\nHe had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sud-\nden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten\nstool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.\nHold the light higher! he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. Look\namong those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,\nthrowing it to him; rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the\nlight higher, you!\nWith a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth,\nand, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the\ncrowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes,\nsome mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face\nto avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the\nchimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped\nwith a cautious touch.\nNothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?\nNothing.\nLet us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light\nthem, you!\nThe turnkey \u0002red the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stoop-\ning again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and\nretraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of\nhearing as they came down, until they were in the raging \u0003ood once\nmore.\nThey found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint\nAntoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the\nguard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the\npeople. Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de\nVille for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the peo-\nple's blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness)\nbe unavenged.\nIn the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to\nencompass this grim old of\u0002cer conspicuous in his grey coat and red dec-\noration, there was but one quite steady \u0002gure, and that was a woman's.\nSee, there is my husband! she cried, pointing him out. See Defarge!\nShe stood immovable close to the grim old of\u0002cer, and remained immov-\nable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets,\nas Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to\nhim when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at\nfrom behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering\nrain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped\ndead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck,\nand with her cruel knifelong readyhewed off his head.\nThe hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible\nidea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.\nSaint Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domina-\ntion by the iron hand was downdown on the steps of the Hotel de\nVille where the governor's body laydown on the sole of the shoe of\nMadame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for\nmutilation. Lower the lamp yonder! cried Saint Antoine, after glar-\ning round for a new means of death; here is one of his soldiers to be\nleft on guard! The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed\non.\nThe sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheav-\ning of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and\nwhose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently\nswaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces\nof suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.\nBut, in the ocean of faces where every \u0002erce and furious expres-\nsion was in vivid life, there were two groups of faceseach seven in\nnumberso \u0002xedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll\nwhich bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners,\nsuddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried\nhigh overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the\nLast Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost\nspirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces,\nwhose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Im-\npassive faces, yet with a suspendednot an abolishedexpression on\nthem; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped\nlids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, Thou didst\nit!\nSeven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the\naccursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and\nother memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,\nsuch, and suchlike, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine es-\ncort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred\nand eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and\nkeep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and\ndangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at De-\nfarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily puri\u0002ed when once stained\nred.", "index": 26}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 22, "chapter_title": "The Sea Still Rises", "chapter_text": "Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which\nto soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he\ncould, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when\nMadame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the cus-\ntomers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great broth-\nerhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of\ntrusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets\nhad a portentously elastic swing with them.\nMadame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light\nand heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there\nwere several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with\na manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest\nnightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked signi\u0002cance\nin it: I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to\nsupport life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me,\nthe wearer of this, to destroy life in you? Every lean bare arm, that had\nbeen without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that\nit could strike. The \u0002ngers of the knitting women were vicious, with the\nexperience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of\nSaint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of\nyears, and the last \u0002nishing blows had told mightily on the expression.\nMadame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as\nwas to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of\nher sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a\nstarved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant\nhad already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.\nHark! said The Vengeance. Listen, then! Who comes?\nAs if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint An-\ntoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly \u0002red, a fast-\nspreading murmur came rushing along.\nIt is Defarge, said madame. Silence, patriots!\nDefarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked\naround him! Listen, everywhere! said madame again. Listen to\nhim! Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and\nopen mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop\nhad sprung to their feet.\nSay then, my husband. What is it?\nNews from the other world!\nHow, then? cried madame, contemptuously. The other world?\nDoes everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished peo-\nple that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?\nEverybody! from all throats.\nThe news is of him. He is among us!\nAmong us! from the universal throat again. And dead?\nNot dead! He feared us so muchand with reasonthat he caused\nhimself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But\nthey have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him\nin. I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner.\nI have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! Had he reason?\nWretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had\nnever known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he\ncould have heard the answering cry.\nA moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife\nlooked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar\nof a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.\nPatriots! said Defarge, in a determined voice, are we ready?\nInstantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was\nbeating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had \u0003own together by\nmagic; and The Vengeance, uttering terri\u0002c shrieks, and \u0003inging her\narms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from\nhouse to house, rousing the women.\nThe men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they\nlooked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pour-\ning down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the bold-\nest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded,\nfrom their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the\nbare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urg-\ning one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and\nactions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother!\nMiscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into\nthe midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and scream-\ning, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat\ngrass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when\nI had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck\ngrass, when these breasts where dry with want! O mother of God, this\nFoulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my with-\nered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on\nFoulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of\nFoulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give\nus the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him\ninto the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, num-\nbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and\ntearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon,\nand were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled\nunder foot.\nNevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon\nwas at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine\nknew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women\n\u0003ocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after\nthem with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there\nwas not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones\nand the wailing children.\nNo. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination\nwhere this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and over\u0003owing into the\nadjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The\nVengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the \u0002rst press, and at no great\ndistance from him in the Hall.\nSee! cried madame, pointing with her knife. See the old villain\nbound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his\nback. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now! Madame put\nher knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.\nThe people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the\ncause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explain-\ning to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded\nwith the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of\ndrawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame De-\nfarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvel-\nlous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who\nhad by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external archi-\ntecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and\nacted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.\nAt length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope\nor protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. The favour\nwas too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that\nhad stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had\ngot him!\nIt was known directly, to the furthest con\u0002nes of the crowd. De-\nfarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miser-\nable wretch in a deadly embraceMadame Defarge had but followed\nand turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tiedThe\nVengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men\nat the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey\nfrom their high percheswhen the cry seemed to go up, all over the city,\nBring him out! Bring him to the lamp!\nDown, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now,\non his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck\nat, and sti\u0003ed by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into\nhis face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet al-\nways entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony\nof action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one an-\nother back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through\na forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one\nof the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him goas a\ncat might have done to a mouseand silently and composedly looked\nat him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women\npassionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling\nout to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft,\nand the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft,\nand the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was\nmerciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass\nenough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.\nNor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so\nshouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing\nwhen the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of\nthe people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard\n\u0002ve hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes\non \u0003aring sheets of paper, seized himwould have torn him out of the\nbreast of an army to bear Foulon companyset his head and heart on\npikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through\nthe streets.\nNot before dark night did the men and women come back to the\nchildren, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were\nbeset by long \u0002les of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while\nthey waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by\nembracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them\nagain in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and\nfrayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and\nslender \u0002res were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in\ncommon, afterwards supping at their doors.\nScanty and insuf\u0002cient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of\nmost other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused\nsome nourishment into the \u0003inty viands, and struck some sparks of\ncheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full\nshare in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;\nand lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and\nhoped.\nIt was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its\nlast knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife,\nin husky tones, while fastening the door:\nAt last it is come, my dear!\nEh well! returned madame. Almost.\nSaint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept\nwith her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was the\nonly voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The\nVengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and\nhad the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon\nwas seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint\nAntoine's bosom.", "index": 27}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 23, "chapter_title": "Fire Rises", "chapter_text": "There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the\nmender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the\nhighway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his\npoor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on\nthe crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,\nbut not many; there were of\u0002cers to guard the soldiers, but not one of\nthem knew what his men would dobeyond this: that it would proba-\nbly not be what he was ordered.\nFar and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.\nEvery green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shriv-\nelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,\ndejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated an-\nimals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore themall worn\nout.\nMonseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a na-\ntional blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of\nluxurious and shining \u0002fe, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nev-\nertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things\nto this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur,\nshould be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be some-\nthing short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was,\nhowever; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the\n\u0003ints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that\nits purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to\nbite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and\nunaccountable.\nBut, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village\nlike it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and\nwrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the plea-\nsures of the chasenow, found in hunting the people; now, found in\nhunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying\nspaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted\nin the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the dis-\nappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beauti\u0002ed and\nbeautifying features of Monseigneur.\nFor, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the\ndust, not often troubling himself to re\u0003ect that dust he was and to dust\nhe must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking\nhow little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he\nhad itin these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and\nviewed the prospect, he would see some rough \u0002gure approaching on\nfoot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a\nfrequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern\nwithout surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian\naspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a\nmender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of\nmany highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds,\nsprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through\nwoods.\nSuch a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,\nas he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he\ncould get from a shower of hail.\nThe man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the\nmill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identi\u0002ed these ob-\njects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just\nintelligible:\nHow goes it, Jacques?\nAll well, Jacques.\nTouch then!\nThey joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.\nNo dinner?\nNothing but supper now, said the mender of roads, with a hungry\nface.\nIt is the fashion, growled the man. I meet no dinner anywhere.\nHe took out a blackened pipe, \u0002lled it, lighted it with \u0003int and steel,\npulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him\nand dropped something into it from between his \u0002nger and thumb, that\nblazed and went out in a puff of smoke.\nTouch then. It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this\ntime, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.\nTo-night? said the mender of roads.\nTo-night, said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.\nWhere?\nHere.\nHe and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently\nat one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy\ncharge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.\nShow me! said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.\nSee! returned the mender of roads, with extended \u0002nger. You go\ndown here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain\nTo the Devil with all that! interrupted the other, rolling his eye\nover the landscape. I go through no streets and past no fountains.\nWell?\nWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the\nvillage.\nGood. When do you cease to work?\nAt sunset.\nWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights\nwithout resting. Let me \u0002nish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child.\nWill you wake me?\nSurely.\nThe wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off\nhis great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones.\nHe was fast asleep directly.\nAs the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds,\nrolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were re-\nsponded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who\nwore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the\n\u0002gure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards\nit, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to\nvery poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard,\nthe coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff\nand hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living,\nand the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired\nthe mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his\nfeet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes,\nstuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many\nlong leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was\ninto sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get\na peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for\nhe slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his\nlips. Forti\u0002ed towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches,\nand drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as\nagainst this \u0002gure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon\nand looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar \u0002gures, stopped\nby no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.\nThe man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\nbrightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps\nof dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed\nthem, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,\nthe mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready\nto go down into the village, roused him.\nGood! said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. Two leagues beyond\nthe summit of the hill?\nAbout.\nAbout. Good!\nThe mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him\naccording to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing\nhimself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing\neven to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the\nvillage had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did,\nbut came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion\nof whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the\nfountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly\nat the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of\nthe place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked\nin that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the\ndarkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan\nwho kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the\ntocsin by-and-bye.\nThe night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping\nits solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threat-\nened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two\nterrace \u0003ights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door,\nlike a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went\nthrough the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lament-\ning up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Mar-\nquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\nheavy-treading, unkempt \u0002gures crushed the high grass and cracked the\nbranches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\nlights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\nwas black again.\nBut, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself\nstrangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing lu-\nminous. Then, a \u0003ickering streak played behind the architecture of the\nfront, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades,\narches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader\nand brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, \u0003ames burst\nforth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of \u0002re.\nA faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who\nwere left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.\nThere was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was\ndrawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam\nstood at Monsieur Gabelle's door. Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!\nThe tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there\nwas none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and \u0002fty particu-\nlar friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar\nof \u0002re in the sky. It must be forty feet high, said they, grimly; and\nnever moved.\nThe rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\nthrough the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\nthe crag. At the gate, a group of of\u0002cers were looking at the \u0002re; re-\nmoved from them, a group of soldiers. Help, gentlemenof\u0002cers!\nThe chateau is on \u0002re; valuable objects may be saved from the \u0003ames by\ntimely aid! Help, help! The of\u0002cers looked towards the soldiers who\nlooked at the \u0002re; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\nof lips, It must burn.\nAs the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\nvillage was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred\nand \u0002fty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea\nof lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles\nin every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\noccasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\nMonsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that\nfunctionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority,\nhad remarked that carriages were good to make bon\u0002res with, and that\npost-horses would roast.\nThe chateau was left to itself to \u0003ame and burn. In the roaring\nand raging of the con\u0003agration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from\nthe infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edi\u0002ce away. With the\nrising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were\nin torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with\nthe two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the\nsmoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the\nstake and contending with the \u0002re.\nThe chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the \u0002re,\nscorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, \u0002red by the four \u0002erce \u0002g-\nures, begirt the blazing edi\u0002ce with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead\nand iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry;\nthe extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat,\nand trickled down into four rugged wells of \u0003ame. Great rents and\nsplits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupe\u0002ed birds\nwheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four \u0002erce \u0002gures trudged\naway, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads,\nguided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.\nThe illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing\nthe lawful ringer, rang for joy.\nNot only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, \u0002re, and\nbell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\nthe collection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment\nof taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days\nbecame impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house,\nsummoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\nMonsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\nwith himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again with-\ndrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\nresolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of re-\ntaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet,\nand crush a man or two below.\nProbably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\ndistant chateau for \u0002re and candle, and the beating at his door, com-\nbined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\nill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\nwhich the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\nA trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\nthe black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\nGabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\nrush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,\nand Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that\nwhile.\nWithin a hundred miles, and in the light of other \u0002res, there were\nother functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the\nrising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had\nbeen born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople\nless fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the\nfunctionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung\nup in their turn. But, the \u0002erce \u0002gures were steadily wending East, West,\nNorth, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, \u0002re burned.\nThe altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,\nno functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate\nsuccessfully.", "index": 28}
{"sub_book_number": "Second", "sub_book_title": "The Golden Thread", "chapter_number": 24, "chapter_title": "Drawn to the Loadstone Rock", "chapter_text": "In such risings of \u0002re and risings of seathe \u0002rm earth shaken by the\nrushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the\n\u0003ow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the\nshorethree years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of\nlittle Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue\nof the life of her home.\nMany a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes\nin the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging\nfeet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a\npeople, tumultuous under a red \u0003ag and with their country declared in\ndanger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted\nin.\nMonseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phe-\nnomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in\nFrance, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from\nit, and this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with\nin\u0002nite pains, and was so terri\u0002ed at the sight of him that he could ask\nthe Enemy no question, but immediately \u0003ed; so, Monseigneur, after\nboldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,\nand performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One,\nno sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.\nThe shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been\nthe mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good\neye to see withhad long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardana\npalus's luxury, and a mole's blindnessbut it had dropped out and was\ngone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten\nring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.\nRoyalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and suspended,\nwhen the last tidings came over.\nThe August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two\nwas come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.\nAs was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Mon-\nseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt\nthe places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without\na guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it\nwas the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied\nupon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a muni\u0002cent house, and ex-\ntended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high\nestate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and\nanticipating plunder or con\u0002scation, had made provident remittances\nto Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.\nTo which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported\nhimself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course. For\nsuch variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intel-\nligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the\npublic, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous,\nthat Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and\nposted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to\nread.\nOn a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and\nCharles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.\nThe penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was\nnow the news-Exchange, and was \u0002lled to over\u0003owing. It was within\nhalf an hour or so of the time of closing.\nBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived, said\nCharles Darnay, rather hesitating, I must still suggest to you\nI understand. That I am too old? said Mr. Lorry.\nUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a\ndisorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\nMy dear Charles, said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful con\u0002dence, you\ntouch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is\nsafe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of\nhard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better\nworth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not\na disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from\nour House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business,\nof old, and is in Tellson's con\u0002dence. As to the uncertain travelling, the\nlong journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit\nmyself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all these\nyears, who ought to be?\nI wish I were going myself, said Charles Darnay, somewhat rest-\nlessly, and like one thinking aloud.\nIndeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise! exclaimed\nMr. Lorry. You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman\nborn? You are a wise counsellor.\nMy dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that\nthe thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed\nthrough my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some\nsympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something\nto them, he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, that one\nmight be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some\nrestraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to\nLucie\nWhen you were talking to Lucie, Mr. Lorry repeated. Yes. I\nwonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing\nyou were going to France at this time of day!\nHowever, I am not going, said Charles Darnay, with a smile. It\nis more to the purpose that you say you are.\nAnd I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles, Mr.\nLorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, you can\nhave no conception of the dif\u0002culty with which our business is trans-\nacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are\ninvolved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences\nwould be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized\nor destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can\nsay that Paris is not set a\u0002re to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judi-\ncious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying\nof them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the\npower (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if\nany one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says\nthisTellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty yearsbecause I\nam a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen\nold codgers here!\nHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\nTut! Nonsense, sir!And, my dear Charles, said Mr. Lorry, glanc-\ning at the House again, you are to remember, that getting things out of\nParis at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossi-\nbility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here\n(I speak in strict con\u0002dence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to\nyou), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had\nhis head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At an-\nother time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like\nOld England; but now, everything is stopped.\nAnd do you really go to-night?\nI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit\nof delay.\nAnd do you take no one with you?\nAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have noth-\ning to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my\nbodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.\nNobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or\nof having any design in his head but to \u0003y at anybody who touches his\nmaster.\nI must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthful-\nness.\nI must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this\nlittle commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire\nand live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.\nThis dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with Mon-\nseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would\ndo to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much\nthe way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was\nmuch too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terri-\nble Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies\nthat had not been sownas if nothing had ever been done, or omitted\nto be done, that had led to itas if observers of the wretched millions\nin France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have\nmade them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before,\nand had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring,\ncombined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restora-\ntion of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out\nHeaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some\nremonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such\nvapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in\nhis own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had al-\nready made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.\nAmong the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his\nway to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching\nto Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminat-\ning them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for\naccomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the aboli-\ntion of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay\nheard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided\nbetween going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to in-\nterpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself\nout.\nThe House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened\nletter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person\nto whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to\nDarnay that he saw the directionthe more quickly because it was his\nown right name. The address, turned into English, ran:\nVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde,\nof France. Con\u0002ded to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,\nLondon, England.\nOn the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one ur-\ngent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name\nshould beunless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligationkept invio-\nlate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife\nhad no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.\nNo, said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; I have referred it, I\nthink, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentle-\nman is to be found.\nThe hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank,\nthere was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk.\nHe held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the\nperson of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked\nat it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,\nand The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in\nEnglish, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.\nNephew, I believebut in any case degenerate successorof the\npolished Marquis who was murdered, said one. Happy to say, I never\nknew him.\nA craven who abandoned his post, said anotherthis Mon-\nseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated,\nin a load of haysome years ago.\nInfected with the new doctrines, said a third, eyeing the direction\nthrough his glass in passing; set himself in opposition to the last Mar-\nquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the\nruf\u0002an herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.\nHey? cried the blatant Stryver. Did he though? Is that the sort\nof fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. Dn the fellow!\nDarnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver\non the shoulder, and said:\nI know the fellow.\nDo you, by Jupiter? said Stryver. I am sorry for it.\nWhy?\nWhy, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these\ntimes.\nBut I do ask why?\nThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry\nto hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,\nwho, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry\nthat ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the\nearth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry\nthat a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you.\nI am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel.\nThat's why.\nMindful of the secret, Darnay with great dif\u0002culty checked himself,\nand said: You may not understand the gentleman.\nI understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay, said Bully\nStryver, and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I don't understand\nhim. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell\nhim, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to\nthis butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,\ngentlemen, said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his \u0002ngers, I\nknow something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never \u0002nd\na fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious\nproteges. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels\nvery early in the scuf\u0003e, and sneak away.\nWith those words, and a \u0002nal snap of his \u0002ngers, Mr. Stryver shoul-\ndered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his\nhearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in\nthe general departure from the Bank.\nWill you take charge of the letter? said Mr. Lorry. You know\nwhere to deliver it?\nI do.\nWill you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been\naddressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and\nthat it has been here some time?\nI will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?\nFrom here, at eight.\nI will come back, to see you off.\nVery ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,\nDarnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened\nthe letter, and read it. These were its contents:\nPrison of the Abbaye, Paris.\nJune 21, 1792.\nMonsieur heretofore the Marquis.\nAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the vil-\nlage, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought\na long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal.\nNor is that all; my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground.\nThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the\nMarquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and\nshall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, trea-\nson against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them\nfor an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them,\nand not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent\nthat, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the\nimposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had\nhad recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for\nan emigrant, and where is that emigrant?\nAh! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that\nemigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will\nhe not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the\nMarquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps\nreach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!\nFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of\nyour noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,\nto succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh\nMonsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!\nFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer\nand nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,\nthe assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.\nYour af\u0003icted,\nGabelle.\nThe latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life\nby this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only\ncrime was \u0002delity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully\nin the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what\nto do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.\nHe knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culmi-\nnated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his\nresentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his con-\nscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,\nhe had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,\nhis renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own\nmind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have\nsystematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant\nto do it, and that it had never been done.\nThe happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of be-\ning always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time\nwhich had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week\nannihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week\nfollowing made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of\nthese circumstances he had yielded:not without disquiet, but still with-\nout continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the\ntimes for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until\nthe time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by\nevery highway and byway, and their property was in course of con\u0002s-\ncation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as\nwell known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that\nmight impeach him for it.\nBut, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was\nso far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had\nrelinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no\nfavour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread.\nMonsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on\nwritten instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there\nwas to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the\nwinter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the\nsummerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his\nown safety, so that it could not but appear now.\nThis favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to\nmake, that he would go to Paris.\nYes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had\ndriven him within the in\u0003uence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was draw-\ning him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind\ndrifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible\nattraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being\nworked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he\nwho could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,\ntrying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy\nand humanity. With this uneasiness half sti\u0003ed, and half reproaching\nhim, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the\nbrave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison\n(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,\nwhich had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were\ncoarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's\nletter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his\njustice, honour, and good name.\nHis resolution was made. He must go to Paris.\nYes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on,\nuntil he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The\nintention with which he had done what he had done, even although he\nhad left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be\ngratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it.\nThen, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine\nmirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw him-\nself in the illusion with some in\u0003uence to guide this raging Revolution\nthat was running so fearfully wild.\nAs he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that\nneither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie\nshould be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant\nto turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come\nto the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of\nsuspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation\nwas referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving\nold associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself.\nBut, that circumstance too, had had its in\u0003uence in his course.\nHe walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to\nreturn to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived\nin Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say\nnothing of his intention now.\nA carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry\nwas booted and equipped.\nI have delivered that letter, said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. I\nwould not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but\nperhaps you will take a verbal one?\nThat I will, and readily, said Mr. Lorry, if it is not dangerous.\nNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\nWhat is his name? said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in\nhis hand.\nGabelle.\nGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in\nprison?\nSimply, `that he has received the letter, and will come.' \nAny time mentioned?\nHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\nAny person mentioned?\nNo.\nHe helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and\ncloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old\nBank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. My love to Lucie, and to little\nLucie, said Mr. Lorry at parting, and take precious care of them till I\ncome back. Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as\nthe carriage rolled away.\nThat nightit was the fourteenth of Augusthe sat up late, and\nwrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obliga-\ntion he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons\nthat he had, for feeling con\u0002dent that he could become involved in no\npersonal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, con\u0002ding Lucie and\ntheir dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the\nstrongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters\nin proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.\nIt was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the \u0002rst reser-\nvation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve\nthe innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But,\nan affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him reso-\nlute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,\nso strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and\nthe day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her\nscarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-\nbye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a\nvalise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the\nheavy streets, with a heavier heart.\nThe unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the\ntides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left\nhis two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before\nmidnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.\nFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your\nnoble name! was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened\nhis sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and\n\u0003oated away for the Loadstone Rock.", "index": 29}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 1, "chapter_title": "In Secret", "chapter_text": "The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from\nEngland in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and\nninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad\nhorses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and\nunfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;\nbut, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Ev-\nery town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots,\nwith their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who\nstopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their\npapers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back,\nor sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capri-\ncious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and\nIndivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.\nA very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when\nCharles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country\nroads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared\na good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his\njourney's end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common bar-\nrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another\niron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The\nuniversal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken\nin a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could\nnot have felt his freedom more completely gone.\nThis universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway\ntwenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day,\nby riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping\nhim by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had\nbeen days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired\nout, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.\nNothing but the production of the af\u0003icted Gabelle's letter from his\nprison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His dif\u0002culty at the\nguard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey\nto have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as\na man could be, to \u0002nd himself awakened at the small inn to which he\nhad been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.\nAwakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in\nrough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the\nbed.\nEmigrant, said the functionary, I am going to send you on to\nParis, under an escort.\nCitizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could\ndispense with the escort.\nSilence! growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-\nend of his musket. Peace, aristocrat!\nIt is as the good patriot says, observed the timid functionary.\nYou are an aristocrat, and must have an escortand must pay for it.\nI have no choice, said Charles Darnay.\nChoice! Listen to him! cried the same scowling red-cap. As if it\nwas not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!\nIt is always as the good patriot says, observed the functionary.\nRise and dress yourself, emigrant.\nDarnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where\nother patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping,\nby a watch-\u0002re. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he\nstarted with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.\nThe escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured\ncockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on\neither side of him.\nThe escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached\nto his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round\nhis wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their\nfaces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,\nand out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without\nchange, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay\nbetween them and the capital.\nThey travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak,\nand lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly\nclothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched\ntheir ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal\ndiscomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations\nof present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically\ndrunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not\nallow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears\nin his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no refer-\nence to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of\nrepresentations, con\u0002rmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were\nnot yet made.\nBut when they came to the town of Beauvaiswhich they did at\neventide, when the streets were \u0002lled with peoplehe could not conceal\nfrom himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous\ncrowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many\nvoices called out loudly, Down with the emigrant!\nHe stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\nresuming it as his safest place, said:\nEmigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my\nown will?\nYou are a cursed emigrant, cried a farrier, making at him in a\nfurious manner through the press, hammer in hand; and you are a\ncursed aristocrat!\nThe postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's\nbridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, Let\nhim be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.\nJudged! repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. Ay! and\ncondemned as a traitor. At this the crowd roared approval.\nChecking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to\nthe yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on,\nwith the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make\nhis voice heard:\nFriends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\ntraitor.\nHe lies! cried the smith. He is a traitor since the decree. His life\nis forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!\nAt the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd,\nwhich another instant would have brought upon him, the postmas-\nter turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his\nhorse's \u0003anks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double\ngates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the\ncrowd groaned; but, no more was done.\nWhat is this decree that the smith spoke of? Darnay asked the\npostmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the\nyard.\nTruly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.\nWhen passed?\nOn the fourteenth.\nThe day I left England!\nEverybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\nothersif there are not already-banishing all emigrants, and condemn-\ning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said your\nlife was not your own.\nBut there are no such decrees yet?\nWhat do I know! said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders;\nthere may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you\nhave?\nThey rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night,\nand then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the\nmany wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild\nride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long\nand lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster\nof poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights,\nand would \u0002nd the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\ncircling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up\ntogether singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\nBeauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\ninto solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet,\namong impoverished \u0002elds that had yielded no fruits of the earth that\nyear, diversi\u0002ed by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the\nsudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\nway, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\nDaylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was\nclosed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\nWhere are the papers of this prisoner? demanded a resolute-\nlooking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.\nNaturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay re-\nquested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French\ncitizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country\nhad imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\nWhere, repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of\nhim whatever, are the papers of this prisoner?\nThe drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.\nCasting his eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority\nshowed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close\nattention.\nHe left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and\nwent into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses out-\nside the gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\nDarnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\npatriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\ninto the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traf-\n\u0002c and traf\u0002ckers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest peo-\nple, was very dif\u0002cult. A numerous medley of men and women, not to\nmention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth;\nbut, the previous identi\u0002cation was so strict, that they \u0002ltered through\nthe barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew their turn for exam-\nination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or\nsmoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap and\ntri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.\nWhen he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\nthings, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\nwho directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\nescort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\nto dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\nturned and rode away without entering the city.\nHe accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of com-\nmon wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and\nawake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping\nand waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.\nThe light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps\nof the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\nuncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\nof\u0002cer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\nCitizen Defarge, said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip\nof paper to write on. Is this the emigrant Evremonde?\nThis is the man.\nYour age, Evremonde?\nThirty-seven.\nMarried, Evremonde?\nYes.\nWhere married?\nIn England.\nWithout doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?\nIn England.\nWithout doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of\nLa Force.\nJust Heaven! exclaimed Darnay. Under what law, and for what\noffence?\nThe of\u0002cer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\nWe have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were\nhere. He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\nI entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in re-\nsponse to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before\nyou. I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is\nnot that my right?\nEmigrants have no rights, Evremonde, was the stolid reply. The\nof\u0002cer wrote until he had \u0002nished, read over to himself what he had\nwritten, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words In secret.\nDefarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must ac-\ncompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots\nattended them.\nIs it you, said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the\nguardhouse steps and turned into Paris, who married the daughter of\nDoctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?\nYes, replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.\nMy name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint\nAntoine. Possibly you have heard of me.\nMy wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!\nThe word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge,\nto say with sudden impatience, In the name of that sharp female newly-\nborn, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?\nYou heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the\ntruth?\nA bad truth for you, said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows,\nand looking straight before him.\nIndeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\nsudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little\nhelp?\nNone. Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.\nWill you answer me a single question?\nPerhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.\nIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free\ncommunication with the world outside?\nYou will see.\nI am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of\npresenting my case?\nYou will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly\nburied in worse prisons, before now.\nBut never by me, Citizen Defarge.\nDefarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady\nand set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\nthere wasor so Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree.\nHe, therefore, made haste to say:\nIt is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better\nthan I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate\nto Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in\nParis, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into\nthe prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?\nI will do, Defarge doggedly rejoined, nothing for you. My duty\nis to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against\nyou. I will do nothing for you.\nCharles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\nwas touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\nhow used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\nstreets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\ntheir heads, and a few shook their \u0002ngers at him as an aristocrat; other-\nwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more\nremarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to\nwork. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed,\nan excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audi-\nence on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.\nThe few words that he caught from this man's lips, \u0002rst made it known\nto Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign am-\nbassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais)\nhe had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchful-\nness had completely isolated him.\nThat he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\ndeveloped themselves when he left England, he of course knew now.\nThat perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and\nfaster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself\nthat he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen\nthe events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as,\nimagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled\nas the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there\nwas ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which,\nwithin a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon\nthe blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge\nas if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The sharp female\nnewly-born, and called La Guillotine, was hardly known to him, or to\nthe generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be\nsoon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the\ndoers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a\ngentle mind?\nOf unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separa-\ntion from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\ncertainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\nhis mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\narrived at the prison of La Force.\nA man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom De-\nfarge presented The Emigrant Evremonde.\nWhat the Devil! How many more of them! exclaimed the man\nwith the bloated face.\nDefarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and with-\ndrew, with his two fellow-patriots.\nWhat the Devil, I say again! exclaimed the gaoler, left with his\nwife. How many more!\nThe gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question,\nmerely replied, One must have patience, my dear! Three turnkeys\nwho entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and\none added, For the love of Liberty; which sounded in that place like\nan inappropriate conclusion.\nThe prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and \u0002lthy, and\nwith a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the\nnoisome \u0003avour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places\nthat are ill cared for!\nIn secret, too, grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper.\nAs if I was not already full to bursting!\nHe stuck the paper on a \u0002le, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\nawaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and\nfro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in\neither case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his\nsubordinates.\nCome! said the chief, at length taking up his keys, come with\nme, emigrant.\nThrough the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied\nhim by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind\nthem, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\nprisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\nand writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\nmost part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the\nroom.\nIn the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and\ndisgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning\nunreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive\nhim, with every re\u0002nement of manner known to the time, and with all\nthe engaging graces and courtesies of life.\nSo strangely clouded were these re\u0002nements by the prison manners\nand gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor\nand misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed\nto stand in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the\nghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost\nof frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all\nwaiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes\nthat were changed by the death they had died in coming there.\nIt struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the\nother gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to\nappearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extrav-\nagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daugh-\nters who were therewith the apparitions of the coquette, the young\nbeauty, and the mature woman delicately bredthat the inversion of all\nexperience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was\nheightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride\nsome progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!\nIn the name of the assembled companions in misfortune, said a\ngentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, I have\nthe honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with\nyou on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon ter-\nminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so\nhere, to ask your name and condition?\nCharles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information,\nin words as suitable as he could \u0002nd.\nBut I hope, said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his\neyes, who moved across the room, that you are not in secret?\nI do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them\nsay so.\nAh, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\nmembers of our society have been in secret, at \u0002rst, and it has lasted but\na short time. Then he added, raising his voice, I grieve to inform the\nsocietyin secret.\nThere was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed\nthe room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many\nvoicesamong which, the soft and compassionate voices of women\nwere conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement. He\nturned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed\nunder the gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight\nforever.\nThe wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they\nbad ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted\nthem), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a soli-\ntary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\nYours, said the gaoler.\nWhy am I con\u0002ned alone?\nHow do I know!\nI can buy pen, ink, and paper?\nSuch are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At\npresent, you may buy your food, and nothing more.\nThere were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As\nthe gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four\nwalls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind\nof the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\nwas so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\na man who had been drowned and \u0002lled with water. When the gaoler\nwas gone, he thought in the same wandering way, Now am I left, as if\nI were dead. Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned\nfrom it with a sick feeling, and thought, And here in these crawling\ncreatures is the \u0002rst condition of the body after death.\nFive paces by four and a half, \u0002ve paces by four and a half, \u0002ve\npaces by four and a half. The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,\ncounting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muf\u0003ed\ndrums with a wild swell of voices added to them. He made shoes, he\nmade shoes, he made shoes. The prisoner counted the measurement\nagain, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter rep-\netition. The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was\none among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was\nleaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon\nher golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for\nGod's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!\n* * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five\npaces by four and a half. With such scraps tossing and rolling upward\nfrom the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, ob-\nstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this\nextentthat it still rolled in like muf\u0003ed drums, but with the wail of\nvoices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.", "index": 30}

The house belonged to a\ngreat nobleman who had lived in it until he made a \u0003ight from the trou-\nbles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A mere beast\nof the chase \u0003ying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no\nother than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate\nfor whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in\nquestion.\nMonseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves\nfrom the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready\nand willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one\nand indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's\nhouse had been \u0002rst sequestrated, and then con\u0002scated. For, all things\nmoved so fast, and decree followed decree with that \u0002erce precipitation,\nthat now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, pa-\ntriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house,\nand had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its\nstate apartments.\nA place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,\nwould soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.\nFor, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said\nto orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over\nthe counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid,\nbut he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as\nhe very often does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must\ninevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London,\nand also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also\nof a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who\ndanced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's\ncould get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the\ntimes held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out\nhis money.\nWhat money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what\nwould lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish\nin Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and\nwhen they should have violently perished; how many accounts with\nTellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into\nthe next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis\nLorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by\na newly-lighted wood \u0002re (the blighted and unfruitful year was prema-\nturely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper\nshade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room\ndistortedly re\u0003ecta shade of horror.\nHe occupied rooms in the Bank, in his \u0002delity to the House of which\nhe had grown to be a part, lie strong root-ivy. it chanced that they\nderived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main\nbuilding, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.\nAll such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty.\nOn the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive\nstandingfor carriageswhere, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur\nyet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great \u0003aring\n\u0003ambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was\na large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have\nhurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other\nworkshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects,\nMr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the \u0002re. He had opened,\nnot only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had\nclosed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\nFrom the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there\ncame the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescrib-\nable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a\nterrible nature were going up to Heaven.\nThank God, said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, that no one near\nand dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy\non all who are in danger!\nSoon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\nThey have come back! and sat listening. But, there was no loud\nirruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\nclash again, and all was quiet.\nThe nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\nuneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally\nawaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up\nto go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door\nsuddenly opened, and two \u0002gures rushed in, at sight of which he fell\nback in amazement.\nLucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and\nwith that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensi\u0002ed, that it\nseemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give\nforce and power to it in this one passage of her life.\nWhat is this? cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. What is\nthe matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought\nyou here? What is it?\nWith the look \u0002xed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she\npanted out in his arms, imploringly, O my dear friend! My husband!\nYour husband, Lucie?\nCharles.\nWhat of Charles?\nHere.\nHere, in Paris?\nHas been here some daysthree or fourI don't know how\nmanyI can't collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought\nhim here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to\nprison.\nThe old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same mo-\nment, the beg of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and\nvoices came pouring into the courtyard.\nWhat is that noise? said the Doctor, turning towards the window.\nDon't look! cried Mr. Lorry. Don't look out! Manette, for your\nlife, don't touch the blind!\nThe Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window,\nand said, with a cool, bold smile:\nMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a\nBastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Parisin Paris? In France\nwho, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch\nme, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\nMy old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\nbarrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\nknew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger;\nI told Lucie so.What is that noise? His hand was again upon the\nwindow.\nDon't look! cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. No, Lucie,\nmy dear, nor you! He got his arm round her, and held her. Don't be\nso terri\u0002ed, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm\nhaving happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being\nin this fatal place. What prison is he in?\nLa Force!\nLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable\nin your lifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself\nnow, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can\nthink, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part\nto-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must\nbid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You\nmust instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in\na room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for\ntwo minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not\ndelay.\nI will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can\ndo nothing else than this. I know you are true.\nThe old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned\nthe key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the win-\ndow and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's\narm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.\nLooked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in num-\nber, or near enough, to \u0002ll the courtyard: not more than forty or \u0002fty\nin all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate,\nand they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been\nset up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.\nBut, such awful workers, and such awful work!\nThe grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly\nwere two men, whose faces, as their long hair Rapped back when the\nwhirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible\nand cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous\ndisguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them,\nand their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all\nawry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement\nand want of sleep. As these ruf\u0002ans turned and turned, their matted\nlocks now \u0003ung forward over their eyes, now \u0003ung backward over their\nnecks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink;\nand what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what\nwith the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmo-\nsphere seemed gore and \u0002re. The eye could not detect one creature in\nthe group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to\nget next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with\nthe stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with\nthe stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's\nlace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those tri\u0003es through and\nthrough. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharp-\nened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the\nwrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of\ndress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as\nthe frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of\nsparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their\nfrenzied eyes;eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given\ntwenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.\nAll this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or\nof any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it\nwere there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked\nfor explanation in his friend's ashy face.\nThey are, Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully\nround at the locked room, murdering the prisoners. If you are sure\nof what you say; if you really have the power you think you haveas I\nbelieve you havemake yourself known to these devils, and get taken\nto La Force. It may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute\nlater!\nDoctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the\nroom, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.\nHis streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous\ncon\u0002dence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, car-\nried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For\na few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and\nthe unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, sur-\nrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked\nshoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of\nLive the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La\nForce! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner\nEvremonde at La Force! and a thousand answering shouts.\nHe closed the lattice again with a \u0003uttering heart, closed the window\nand the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was\nassisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found\nher child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be\nsurprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat\nwatching them in such quiet as the night knew.\nLucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the \u0003oor at his feet,\nclinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\nbed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty\ncharge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And\nO the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!\nTwice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and\nthe irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.\nWhat is it? cried Lucie, affrighted. Hush! The soldiers' swords are\nsharpened there, said Mr. Lorry. The place is national property now,\nand used as a kind of armoury, my love.\nTwice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and \u0002tful.\nSoon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself\nfrom the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so\nbesmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping\nback to consciousness on a \u0002eld of slain, was rising from the pavement\nby the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.\nShortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of\nthe carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,\nclimbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty\ncushions.\nThe great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out\nagain, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone\nstood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the\nsun had never given, and would never take away.", "index": 31}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 3, "chapter_title": "The Shadow", "chapter_text": "One of the \u0002rst considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\nLorry when business hours came round, was this:that he had no right\nto imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\nthe Bank roof, His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\nfor Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust\nhe held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\nman of business.\nAt \u0002rst, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of \u0002nding\nout the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference\nto the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\nsame consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\nmost violent Quarter, and doubtless was in\u0003uential there, and deep in\nits dangerous workings.\nNoon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's de-\nlay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She\nsaid that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in\nthat Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objec-\ntion to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles,\nand he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\nwent out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\nin a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\nof a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\nTo this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss\nPross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he\nhad himself. He left Jerry with them, as a \u0002gure to \u0002ll a doorway that\nwould bear considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own\noccupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon\nthem, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.\nIt wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed.\nHe was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what\nto do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\nman stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\naddressed him by his name.\nYour servant, said Mr. Lorry. Do you know me?\nHe was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-\u0002ve\nto \u0002fty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\nemphasis, the words:\nDo you know me?\nI have seen you somewhere.\nPerhaps at my wine-shop?\nMuch interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: You come from Doc-\ntor Manette?\nYes. I come from Doctor Manette.\nAnd what says he? What does he send me?\nDefarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore\nthe words in the Doctor's writing:\nCharles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I\nhave obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note\nfrom Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.\nIt was dated from La Force, within an hour.\nWill you accompany me, said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after\nreading this note aloud, to where his wife resides?\nYes, returned Defarge.\nScarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\nway Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into\nthe courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\nMadame Defarge, surely! said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in\nexactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.\nIt is she, observed her husband.\nDoes Madame go with us? inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she\nmoved as they moved.\nYes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the\npersons. It is for their safety.\nBeginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubi-\nously at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second\nwoman being The Vengeance.\nThey passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\nascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and\nfound Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\ntidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\ndelivered his notelittle thinking what it had been doing near him in\nthe night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\nDearest,Take courage. I am well, and your father has\nin\u0003uence around me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child\nfor me.\nThat was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who\nreceived it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of\nthe hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\naction, but the hand made no responsedropped cold and heavy, and\ntook to its knitting again.\nThere was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She\nstopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands\nyet at her neck, looked terri\u0002ed at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge\nmet the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\nMy dear, said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; there are frequent\nrisings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble\nyou, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to\nprotect at such times, to the end that she may know themthat she may\nidentify them. I believe, said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring\nwords, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him\nmore and more, I state the case, Citizen Defarge?\nDefarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than\na gruff sound of acquiescence.\nYou had better, Lucie, said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propiti-\nate, by tone and manner, have the dear child here, and our good Pross.\nOur good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.\nThe lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more\nthan a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and,\ndanger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The\nVengeance, whom her eyes \u0002rst encountered, Well, I am sure, Bold-\nface! I hope you are pretty well! She also bestowed a British cough on\nMadame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\nIs that his child? said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for\nthe \u0002rst time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were\nthe \u0002nger of Fate.\nYes, madame, answered Mr. Lorry; this is our poor prisoner's\ndarling daughter, and only child.\nThe shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed\nto fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinc-\ntively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\nshadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to\nfall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\nIt is enough, my husband, said Madame Defarge. I have seen\nthem. We may go.\nBut, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in itnot visible\nand presented, but indistinct and withheldto alarm Lucie into saying,\nas she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:\nYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm.\nYou will help me to see him if you can?\nYour husband is not my business here, returned Madame Defarge,\nlooking down at her with perfect composure. It is the daughter of your\nfather who is my business here.\nFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake!\nShe will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are\nmore afraid of you than of these others.\nMadame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her\nhusband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and\nlooking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.\nWhat is it that your husband says in that little letter? asked\nMadame Defarge, with a lowering smile. In\u0003uence; he says something\ntouching in\u0003uence?\nThat my father, said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\nbreast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, has\nmuch in\u0003uence around him.\nSurely it will release him! said Madame Defarge. Let it do so.\nAs a wife and mother, cried Lucie, most earnestly, I implore you\nto have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess,\nagainst my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman,\nthink of me. As a wife and mother!\nMadame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,\nturning to her friend The Vengeance:\nThe wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were\nas little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?\nWe have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from\nthem, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer,\nin themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\nsickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?\nWe have seen nothing else, returned The Vengeance.\nWe have borne this a long time, said Madame Defarge, turning\nher eyes again upon Lucie. Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of\none wife and mother would be much to us now?\nShe resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed.\nDefarge went last, and closed the door.\nCourage, my dear Lucie, said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her.\nCourage, courage! So far all goes well with usmuch, much better\nthan it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a\nthankful heart.\nI am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw\na shadow on me and on all my hopes.\nTut, tut! said Mr. Lorry; what is this despondency in the brave\nlittle breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.\nBut the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon\nhimself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.", "index": 32}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 4, "chapter_title": "Calm in Storm", "chapter_text": "Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of\nhis absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as\ncould be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from\nher, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart,\ndid she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes\nand all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights\nhad been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her\nhad been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an\nattack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger,\nand that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.\nTo Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of se-\ncrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him\nthrough a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison\nhe had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prison-\ners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be\nput forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent\nback to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal,\nhe had announced himself by name and profession as having been for\neighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one\nof the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identi\u0002ed him, and that\nthis man was Defarge.\nThat, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the ta-\nble, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded\nhard to the Tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some\nawake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some\nnotfor his life and liberty. That, in the \u0002rst frantic greetings lavished\non himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had\nbeen accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the law-\nless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at\nonce released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained\ncheck (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of se-\ncret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed\nDoctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should,\nfor his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on\na signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again;\nbut, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to\nremain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice\nor mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside\nthe gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the\npermission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger\nwas over.\nThe sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\nintervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\nsaved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\nthose who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who\nhad been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage\nhad thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and\ndress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had\nfound him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated\non the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as\nanything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended\nthe wounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for\nhim and escorted him carefully from the spothad then caught up their\nweapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor\nhad covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of\nit.\nAs Mr. Lorry received these con\u0002dences, and as he watched the face\nof his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him\nthat such dread experiences would revive the old danger.\nBut, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\nat all known him in his present character. For the \u0002rst time the Doctor\nfelt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the \u0002rst time\nhe felt that in that sharp \u0002re, he had slowly forged the iron which could\nbreak the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him. It\nall tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As\nmy beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful\nnow in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven\nI will do it! Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the\nkindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the\nman whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock,\nfor so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had\nlain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\nGreater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with,\nwould have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept him-\nself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of\nmankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his per-\nsonal in\u0003uence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of\nthree prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\nthat her husband was no longer con\u0002ned alone, but was mixed with\nthe general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought\nsweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband\nhimself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she\nwas not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions\nof plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\nknown to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\nThis new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still,\nthe sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.\nNothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;\nbut he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time,\nhis imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and\nhis friend, with his personal af\u0003iction, deprivation, and weakness. Now\nthat this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that\nold trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate\nsafety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he\ntook the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to\nhim as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lu-\ncie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could\nreverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some\nservice to her who had rendered so much to him. All curious to see,\nthought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, but all natural and\nright; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in\nbetter hands.\nBut, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\nCharles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the\npublic current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era\nbegan; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Lib-\nerty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against\nthe world in arms; the black \u0003ag waved night and day from the great\ntowers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise\nagainst the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France,\nas if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit\nequally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the\nbright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and\nforest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped\ngrass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad\nrivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could\nrear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Libertythe deluge\nrising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of\nHeaven shut, not opened!\nThere was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest,\nno measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as\nwhen time was young, and the evening and morning were the \u0002rst day,\nother count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging\nfever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the\nunnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the\nhead of the kingand now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the\nhead of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned\nwidowhood and misery, to turn it grey.\nAnd yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains\nin all such cases, the time was long, while it \u0003amed by so fast. A revolu-\ntionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or \u0002fty thousand revolutionary\ncommittees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away\nall security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent\nperson to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had\ncommitted no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became\nthe established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be\nancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous\n\u0002gure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from\nthe foundations of the worldthe \u0002gure of the sharp female called La\nGuillotine.\nIt was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,\nit infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar\ndelicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved\nclose: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and\nsneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human\nrace. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from\nwhich the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed\nin where the Cross was denied.\nIt sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most pol-\nluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a\nyoung Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It\nhushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful\nand good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living\nand one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many\nminutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended\nto the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger\nthan his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own\nTemple every day.\nAmong these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor\nwalked with a steady head: con\u0002dent in his power, cautiously persistent\nin his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last.\nYet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried\nthe time away so \u0002ercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and\nthree months when the Doctor was thus steady and con\u0002dent. So much\nmore wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December\nmonth, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of\nthe violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and\nsquares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among\nthe terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at\nthat day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable\nin hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims,\nhe was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the\nstory of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was\nnot suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed\nbeen recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving\namong mortals.", "index": 33}

During all that time Lucie was never sure,\nfrom hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her hus-\nband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils\nnow jolted heavily, \u0002lled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women,\nbrown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old;\ngentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily\nbrought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and\ncarried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty,\nequality, fraternity, or death;the last, much the easiest to bestow, O\nGuillotine!\nIf the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the\ntime, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle\ndespair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from\nthe hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom\nin the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was\ntruest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good\nwill always be.\nAs soon as they were established in their new residence, and her fa-\nther had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little\nhousehold as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had\nits appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as\nregularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The slight\ndevices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that\nthey would soon be reunitedthe little preparations for his speedy re-\nturn, the setting aside of his chair and his booksthese, and the solemn\nprayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many un-\nhappy souls in prison and the shadow of deathwere almost the only\noutspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.\nShe did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin\nto mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and\nas well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her\ncolour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occa-\nsional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Some-\ntimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief\nshe had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under\nHeaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: Nothing can\nhappen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him,\nLucie.\nThey had not made the round of their changed life many weeks,\nwhen her father said to her, on coming home one evening:\nMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles\ncan sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to\nitwhich depends on many uncertainties and incidentshe might see\nyou in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can\nshow you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even\nif you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\nO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\nFrom that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the\nclock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.\nWhen it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they\nwent together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a\nsingle day.\nIt was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel\nof a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that\nend; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed\nher.\nGood day, citizeness.\nGood day, citizen.\nThis mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been es-\ntablished voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;\nbut, was now law for everybody.\nWalking here again, citizeness?\nYou see me, citizen!\nThe wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of ges-\nture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison,\npointed at the prison, and putting his ten \u0002ngers before his face to rep-\nresent bars, peeped through them jocosely.\nBut it's not my business, said he. And went on sawing his wood.\nNext day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment\nshe appeared.\nWhat? Walking here again, citizeness?\nYes, citizen.\nAh! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?\nDo I say yes, mamma? whispered little Lucie, drawing close to\nher.\nYes, dearest.\nYes, citizen.\nAh! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my\nsaw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head\ncomes!\nThe billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.\nI call myself the Samson of the \u0002rewood guillotine. See here again!\nLoo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her head comes! Now, a child.\nTickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All the family!\nLucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it\nwas impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not\nbe in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke\nto him \u0002rst, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.\nHe was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite\nforgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her\nheart up to her husband, she would come to herself to \u0002nd him looking\nat her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. But\nit's not my business! he would generally say at those times, and would\nbriskly fall to his sawing again.\nIn all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds\nof spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and\nagain in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every\nday at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.\nHer husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once\nin \u0002ve or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not\nfor a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did\nsee her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have\nwaited out the day, seven days a week.\nThese occupations brought her round to the December month,\nwherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On\na lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a\nday of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses,\nas she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps\nstuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the stan-\ndard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One\nand Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!\nThe miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole\nsurface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got\nsomebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death\nin with most inappropriate dif\u0002culty. On his house-top, he displayed\npike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed\nhis saw inscribed as his Little Sainte Guillotinefor the great sharp\nfemale was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he\nwas not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.\nBut, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement\nand a shouting coming along, which \u0002lled her with fear. A moment af-\nterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the\nprison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand\nwith The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than \u0002ve hundred people,\nand they were dancing like \u0002ve thousand demons. There was no other\nmusic than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution\nsong, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in uni-\nson. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men\ndanced together, as hazard had brought them together. At \u0002rst, they\nwere a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as\nthey \u0002lled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly\napparition of a dance-\u0002gure gone raving mad arose among them. They\nadvanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one an-\nother's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round\nin pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest\nlinked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,\nand in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they\nall stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then re-\nversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped\nagain, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width\nof the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high\nup, swooped screaming off. No \u0002ght could have been half so terrible\nas this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sporta something, once\ninnocent, delivered over to all devilrya healthy pastime changed into\na means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the\nheart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how\nwarped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maid-\nenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted,\nthe delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of\nthe disjointed time.\nThis was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and\nbewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery\nsnow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.\nO my father! for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes\nshe had momentarily darkened with her hand; such a cruel, bad sight.\nI know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be\nfrightened! Not one of them would harm you.\nI am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my\nhusband, and the mercies of these people\nWe will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing\nto the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You\nmay kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.\nI do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!\nYou cannot see him, my poor dear?\nNo, father, said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her\nhand, no.\nA footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. I salute you, citizeness,\nfrom the Doctor. I salute you, citizen. This in passing. Nothing more.\nMadame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.\nGive me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerful-\nness and courage, for his sake. That was well done; they had left the\nspot; it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.\nFor to-morrow!\nThere is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precau-\ntions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually sum-\nmoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I\nknow that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed\nto the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?\nShe could scarcely answer, I trust in you.\nDo so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he\nshall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him\nwith every protection. I must see Lorry.\nHe stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.\nThey both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three\ntumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.\nI must see Lorry, the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.\nThe staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He\nand his books were in frequent requisition as to property con\u0002scated\nand made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No\nbetter man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to\nhold his peace.\nA murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, de-\nnoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at\nthe Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted\nand deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the let-\nters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,\nFraternity, or Death!\nWho could that be with Mr. Lorrythe owner of the riding-coat\nupon the chairwho must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did\nhe come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms?\nTo whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his\nvoice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he\nhad issued, he said: Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for\nto-morrow?", "index": 34}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 6, "chapter_title": "Triumph", "chapter_text": "The dread tribunal of \u0002ve Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\nJury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read\nout by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard\ngaoler-joke was, Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside\nthere!\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay!\nSo at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.\nWhen a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot re-\nserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he\nhad seen hundreds pass away so.\nHis bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over\nthem to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through\nthe list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-\nthree names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the pris-\noners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had\nalready been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted\nchamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night\nof his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every\nhuman creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the\nscaffold.\nThere were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting\nwas soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La\nForce were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and\na little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed\ntears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to\nbe re\u0002lled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when\nthe common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great\ndogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far\nfrom insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the\ntime. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or\nintoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave\nthe guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness,\nbut a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of\npestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea\nterrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders\nhidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.\nThe passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in\nits vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, \u0002fteen prisoners\nwere put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the\n\u0002fteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour\nand a half.\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay, was at length arraigned.\nHis judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red\ncap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.\nLooking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought\nthat the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were\ntrying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a\ncity, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the direct-\ning spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,\nanticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,\nthe greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore\nknives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knit-\nted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her\narm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom\nhe had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly\nremembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in\nhis ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in\nthe two \u0002gures was, that although they were posted as close to himself\nas they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be\nwaiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at\nthe Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,\nin his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.\nLorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who\nwore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the\nCarmagnole.\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public pros-\necutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the\ndecree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing\nthat the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and\nthere was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was\ndemanded.\nTake off his head! cried the audience. An enemy to the Repub-\nlic!\nThe President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the pris-\noner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?\nUndoubtedly it was.\nWas he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?\nNot an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.\nWhy not? the President desired to know.\nBecause he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to\nhim, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country\nhe submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the\nTribunal was in useto live by his own industry in England, rather than\non the industry of the overladen people of France.\nWhat proof had he of this?\nHe handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and\nAlexandre Manette.\nBut he had married in England? the President reminded him.\nTrue, but not an English woman.\nA citizeness of France?\nYes. By birth.\nHer name and family?\nLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physi-\ncian who sits there.\nThis answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exal-\ntation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously\nwere the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several fe-\nrocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment\nbefore, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill\nhim.\nOn these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his\nfoot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same\ncautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had pre-\npared every inch of his road.\nThe President asked, why had he returned to France when he did,\nand not sooner?\nHe had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no\nmeans of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in Eng-\nland, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.\nHe had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of\na French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his\nabsence. He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his tes-\ntimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in\nthe eyes of the Republic?\nThe populace cried enthusiastically, No! and the President rang\nhis bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry No!\nuntil they left off, of their own will.\nThe President required the name of that citizen. The accused ex-\nplained that the citizen was his \u0002rst witness. He also referred with con-\n\u0002dence to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the\nBarrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers\nthen before the President.\nThe Doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him\nthat it would be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was pro-\nduced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to con\u0002rm it, and did so.\nCitizen Gabelle hinted, with in\u0002nite delicacy and politeness, that in the\npressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of en-\nemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly\noverlooked in his prison of the Abbayein fact, had rather passed out\nof the Tribunal's patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago; when he\nhad been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's\ndeclaring themselves satis\u0002ed that the accusation against him was an-\nswered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called\nDarnay.\nDoctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,\nand the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he pro-\nceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his \u0002rst friend on his release\nfrom his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England,\nalways faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile;\nthat, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there,\nhe had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and\nfriend of the United Statesas he brought these circumstances into view,\nwith the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth\nand earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when\nhe appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and\nthere present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial\nand could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had\nheard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President\nwere content to receive them.\nAt every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the pop-\nulace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's\nfavour, and the President declared him free.\nThen, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the popu-\nlace sometimes grati\u0002ed their \u0002ckleness, or their better impulses towards\ngenerosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against\ntheir swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which\nof these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,\nto a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner\nwas the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood\nat another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the\nprisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his\nlong and unwholesome con\u0002nement he was in danger of fainting from\nexhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same\npeople, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the\nvery same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.\nHis removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to\nbe tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were\nto be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as\nthey had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to\ncompensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these \u0002ve came\ndown to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-\nfour hours. The \u0002rst of them told him so, with the customary prison\nsign of Deatha raised \u0002ngerand they all added in words, Long live\nthe Republic!\nThe \u0002ve had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,\nfor when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a\ngreat crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen\nin Courtexcept two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out,\nthe concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all\nby turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of\nwhich the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on\nthe shore.\nThey put him into a great chair they had among them, and which\nthey had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or\npassages. Over the chair they had thrown a red \u0003ag, and to the back of\nit they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph,\nnot even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his\nhome on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about\nhim, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces,\nthat he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and\nthat he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.\nIn wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and point-\ning him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the\nprevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them,\nas they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they car-\nried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her\nfather had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood\nupon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\nAs he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between\nhis face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might\ncome together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all\nthe rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard over\u0003owed with the Carmag-\nnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from\nthe crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and\nover\u0003owing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank, and\nover the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled\nthem away.\nAfter grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud\nbefore him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in\nbreathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;\nafter kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his\nneck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted\nher; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.\nLucie! My own! I am safe.\nO dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have\nprayed to Him.\nThey all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was\nagain in his arms, he said to her:\nAnd now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this\nFrance could have done what he has done for me.\nShe laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor\nhead on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return\nhe had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud\nof his strength. You must not be weak, my darling, he remonstrated;\ndon't tremble so. I have saved him.", "index": 35}

And yet his wife trembled, and a\nvague but heavy fear was upon her.\nAll the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passion-\nately revengeful and \u0002tful, the innocent were so constantly put to death\non vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that\nmany as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to\nher, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her\nheart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The\nshadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now\nthe dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued\nthem, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer\nto his real presence and trembled more.\nHer father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this\nwoman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoe-\nmaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accom-\nplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had\nsaved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.\nTheir housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that\nwas the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but\nbecause they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,\nhad had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards\nthe living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly\nto avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness\nwho acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional\nservice; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had\nbecome their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.\nIt was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,\nEquality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every\nhouse, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters\nof a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.\nJerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down\nbelow; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name\nhimself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette\nhad employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called\nDarnay.\nIn the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual\nharmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as\nin very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted\nwere purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small\nshops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possi-\nble for talk and envy, was the general desire.\nFor some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged\nthe of\u0002ce of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the\nbasket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were\nlighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such\npurchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long as-\nsociation with a French family, might have known as much of their\nlanguage as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\ndirection; consequently she knew no more of that nonsense (as she\nwas pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of mar-\nketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper\nwithout any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened\nnot to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing,\nlay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She\nalways made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just\nprice, one \u0002nger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number\nmight be.\nNow, Mr. Cruncher, said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with\nfelicity; if you are ready, I am.\nJerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had\nworn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would \u0002le his spiky head\ndown.\nThere's all manner of things wanted, said Miss Pross, and we\nshall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice\ntoasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.\nIt will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,\nretorted Jerry, whether they drink your health or the Old Un's.\nWho's he? said Miss Pross.\nMr. Cruncher, with some dif\u0002dence, explained himself as meaning\nOld Nick's.\nHa! said Miss Pross, it doesn't need an interpreter to explain\nthe meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight\nMurder, and Mischief.\nHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious! cried Lucie.\nYes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious, said Miss Pross; but I may say\namong ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey\nsmotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.\nNow, Ladybird, never you stir from that \u0002re till I come back! Take care\nof the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty\nhead from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I\nask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?\nI think you may take that liberty, the Doctor answered, smiling.\nFor gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough\nof that, said Miss Pross.\nHush, dear! Again? Lucie remonstrated.\nWell, my sweet, said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically,\nthe short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gra-\ncious Majesty King George the Third; Miss Pross curtseyed at the\nname; and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate\ntheir knavish tricks, On him our hopes we \u0002x, God save the King!\nMr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words\nafter Miss Pross, like somebody at church.\nI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though\nI wish you had never taken that cold in your voice, said Miss Pross,\napprovingly. But the question, Doctor Manette. Is thereit was the\ngood creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great\nanxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manneris there\nany prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?\nI fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\nHeigh-ho-hum! said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as\nshe glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the \u0002re, then we\nmust have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and\n\u0002ght low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!\nDon't you move, Ladybird!\nThey went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the\nchild, by a bright \u0002re. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the\nBanking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside\nin a corner, that they might enjoy the \u0002re-light undisturbed. Little Lucie\nsat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,\nin a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of\na great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out\na captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and\nquiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.\nWhat is that? she cried, all at once.\nMy dear! said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his\nhand on hers, command yourself. What a disordered state you are in!\nThe least thingnothingstartles you! You, your father's daughter!\nI thought, my father, said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face\nand in a faltering voice, that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.\nMy love, the staircase is as still as Death.\nAs he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.\nOh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!\nMy child, said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her\nshoulder, I have saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me\ngo to the door.\nHe took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer\nrooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the \u0003oor, and four\nrough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.\nThe Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay, said the \u0002rst.\nWho seeks him? answered Darnay.\nI seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before\nthe Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.\nThe four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child\nclinging to him.\nTell me how and why am I again a prisoner?\nIt is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will\nknow to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.\nDoctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that\nbe stood with the lamp in his hand, as if be woe a statue made to hold\nit, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and con-\nfronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of\nhis red woollen shirt, said:\nYou know him, you have said. Do you know me?\nYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\nWe all know you, Citizen Doctor, said the other three.\nHe looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower\nvoice, after a pause:\nWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\nCitizen Doctor, said the \u0002rst, reluctantly, he has been denounced\nto the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen, pointing out the second\nwho had entered, is from Saint Antoine.\nThe citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:\nHe is accused by Saint Antoine.\nOf what? asked the Doctor.\nCitizen Doctor, said the \u0002rst, with his former reluctance, ask no\nmore. If the Republic demands sacri\u0002ces from you, without doubt you\nas a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before\nall. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\nOne word, the Doctor entreated. Will you tell me who de-\nnounced him?\nIt is against rule, answered the \u0002rst; but you can ask Him of\nSaint Antoine here.\nThe Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on\nhis feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:\nWell! Truly it is against rule. But he is denouncedand gravely\nby the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.\nWhat other?\nDo you ask, Citizen Doctor?\nYes.\nThen, said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, you will be\nanswered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!", "index": 36}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 8, "chapter_title": "A Hand at Cards", "chapter_text": "Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded\nher way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge\nof the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable\npurchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at\nher side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of\nthe shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of\npeople, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group\nof talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye\nwith blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the\nbarges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the\nArmy of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with that\nArmy, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard\nhad never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.\nHaving purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of\noil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.\nAfter peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the\nGood Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,\nonce (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her\nfancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description\nthey had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as\nthe rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and \u0002nding him of her opinion, Miss\nPross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by\nher cavalier.\nSlightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,\nplaying with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,\nbare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of\nthe others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be\nresumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in\nthe popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that atti-\ntude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers ap-\nproached the counter, and showed what they wanted.\nAs their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man\nin a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No\nsooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped\nher hands.\nIn a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody\nwas assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was\nthe likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but\nonly saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man\nwith all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican;\nthe woman, evidently English.\nWhat was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples\nof the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was some-\nthing very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or\nChaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all\nears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must\nbe recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agi-\ntation, but, Mr. Cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate and\nindividual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder.\nWhat is the matter? said the man who had caused Miss Pross to\nscream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and\nin English.\nOh, Solomon, dear Solomon! cried Miss Pross, clapping her\nhands again. After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for\nso long a time, do I \u0002nd you here!\nDon't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?\nasked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.\nBrother, brother! cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. Have I\never been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\nThen hold your meddlesome tongue, said Solomon, and come\nout, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out.\nWho's this man?\nMiss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means\naffectionate brother, said through her tears, Mr. Cruncher.\nLet him come out too, said Solomon. Does he think me a\nghost?\nApparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not\na word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\nthrough her tears with great dif\u0002culty paid for her wine. As she did so,\nSolomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of An-\ntiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language,\nwhich caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.\nNow, said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, what do\nyou want?\nHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my\nlove away from! cried Miss Pross, to give me such a greeting, and\nshow me no affection.\nThere. Confound it! There, said Solomon, making a dab at Miss\nPross's lips with his own. Now are you content?\nMiss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\nIf you expect me to be surprised, said her brother Solomon, I am\nnot surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are\nhere. If you really don't want to endanger my existencewhich I half\nbelieve you dogo your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine.\nI am busy. I am an of\u0002cial.\nMy English brother Solomon, mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\ntear-fraught eyes, that had the makings in him of one of the best and\ngreatest of men in his native country, an of\u0002cial among foreigners, and\nsuch foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in\nhis\nI said so! cried her brother, interrupting. I knew it. You want\nto be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister.\nJust as I am getting on!\nThe gracious and merciful Heavens forbid! cried Miss Pross. Far\nrather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\nloved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,\nand tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will\ndetain you no longer.\nGood Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come\nof any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact,\nyears ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had\nspent her money and left her!\nHe was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more\ngrudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if\ntheir relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invari-\nably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on\nthe shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following\nsingular question:\nI say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John\nSolomon, or Solomon John?\nThe of\u0002cial turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\npreviously uttered a word.\nCome! said Mr. Cruncher. Speak out, you know. (Which,\nby the way, was more than he could do himself.) John Solomon, or\nSolomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your\nsister. And I know you're John, you know. Which of the two goes \u0002rst?\nAnd regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name\nover the water.\nWhat do you mean?\nWell, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your\nname was, over the water.\nNo?\nNo. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.\nIndeed?\nYes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy\nwitness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own\nfather to yourself, was you called at that time?\nBarsad, said another voice, striking in.\nThat's the name for a thousand pound! cried Jerry.\nThe speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands\nbehind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr.\nCruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey\nitself.\nDon't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's,\nto his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present\nmyself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present\nmyself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better\nemployed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was\nnot a Sheep of the Prisons.\nSheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The\nspy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared\nI'll tell you, said Sydney. I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming\nout of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the\nwalls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I\nremember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection,\nand having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you\nwith the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\ndirection. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near\nyou. I had no dif\u0002culty in deducing from your unreserved conversation,\nand the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature\nof your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to\nshape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\nWhat purpose? the spy asked.\nIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in\nthe street. Could you favour me, in con\u0002dence, with some minutes of\nyour companyat the of\u0002ce of Tellson's Bank, for instance?\nUnder a threat?\nOh! Did I say that?\nThen, why should I go there?\nReally, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.\nDo you mean that you won't say, sir? the spy irresolutely asked.\nYou apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't.\nCarton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of\nhis quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\nand with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\nmade the most of it.\nNow, I told you so, said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his\nsister; if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing.\nCome, come, Mr. Barsad! exclaimed Sydney. Don't be ungrate-\nful. But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up\nso pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\nsatisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?\nI'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you.\nI propose that we \u0002rst conduct your sister safely to the corner of\nher own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good\ncity, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort\nknows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we\nready? Come then!\nMiss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life re-\nmembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked\nup in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a\nbraced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which\nnot only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man.\nShe was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so\nlittle deserved her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, ad-\nequately to heed what she observed.\nThey left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to\nMr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or\nSolomon Pross, walked at his side.\nMr. Lorry had just \u0002nished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery\nlittle log or two of \u0002reperhaps looking into their blaze for the picture\nof that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into\nthe red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago.\nHe turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which\nhe saw a stranger.\nMiss Pross's brother, sir, said Sydney. Mr. Barsad.\nBarsad? repeated the old gentleman, Barsad? I have an associa-\ntion with the nameand with the face.\nI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad, observed Car-\nton, coolly. Pray sit down.\nAs he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry\nwanted, by saying to him with a frown, Witness at that trial. Mr.\nLorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an\nundisguised look of abhorrence.\nMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate\nbrother you have heard of, said Sydney, and has acknowledged the\nrelationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\nStruck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, What do\nyou tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am\nabout to return to him!\nArrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\nJust now, if at all.\nMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir, said Sydney, and I\nhave it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep\nover a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the mes-\nsengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\nearthly doubt that he is retaken.\nMr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss\nof time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\nmight depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\nsilently attentive.\nNow, I trust, said Sydney to him, that the name and in\u0003uence of\nDoctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrowyou said\nhe would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?\nYes; I believe so.\nIn as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I\nown to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having\nhad the power to prevent this arrest.\nHe may not have known of it beforehand, said Mr. Lorry.\nBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember\nhow identi\u0002ed he is with his son-in-law.\nThat's true, Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at\nhis chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\nIn short, said Sydney, this is a desperate time, when desperate\ngames are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning\ngame; I will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase.\nAny one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomor-\nrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is\na friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win,\nis Mr. Barsad.\nYou need have good cards, sir, said the spy.\nI'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,Mr. Lorry, you know what\na brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\nIt was put before him, and he drank off a glassfuldrank off an-\nother glassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\nMr. Barsad, he went on, in the tone of one who really was look-\ning over a hand at cards: Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican\ncommittees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\nso much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is\nless open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a French-\nman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's\na very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\nFrench government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic En-\nglish government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent\ncard. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad,\nstill in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt,\nthe treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English\ntraitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so dif\u0002cult to\n\u0002nd. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr.\nBarsad?\nNot to understand your play, returned the spy, somewhat un-\neasily.\nI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section\nCommittee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have.\nDon't hurry.\nHe drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\ndrank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into\na \u0002t state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured\nout and drank another glassful.\nLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\nIt was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing\ncards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his hon-\nourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard\nswearing therenot because he was not wanted there; our English rea-\nsons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\ndatehe knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service\nin France: \u0002rst, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own coun-\ntrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the\nnatives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a\nspy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the\nwatchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's\nimprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an intro-\nduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on\nMadame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always\nremembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knit-\nted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her\n\u0002ngers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine,\nover and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people\nwhose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every\none employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that \u0003ight was im-\npossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that\nin spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the\nreigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced,\nand on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind,\nhe foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he\nhad seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register,\nand would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are\nmen soon terri\u0002ed, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to\njustify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.\nYou scarcely seem to like your hand, said Sydney, with the greatest\ncomposure. Do you play?\nI think, sir, said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to\nMr. Lorry, I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence,\nto put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can\nunder any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of\nwhich he has spoken. I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered\na discreditable stationthough it must be \u0002lled by somebody; but this\ngentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make\nhimself one?\nI play my Ace, Mr. Barsad, said Carton, taking the answer on\nhimself, and looking at his watch, without any scruple, in a very few\nminutes.\nI should have hoped, gentlemen both, said the spy, always striving\nto hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, that your respect for my sister\n\nI could not better testify my respect for your sister than by \u0002nally\nrelieving her of her brother, said Sydney Carton.\nYou think not, sir?\nI have thoroughly made up my mind about it.\nThe smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his os-\ntentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, re-\nceived such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,who was a mys-\ntery to wiser and honester men than he,that it faltered here and failed\nhim. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of\ncontemplating cards:\nAnd indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that\nI have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and\nfellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;\nwho was he?\nFrench. You don't know him, said the spy, quickly.\nFrench, eh? repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice\nhim at all, though he echoed his word. Well; he may be.\nIs, I assure you, said the spy; though it's not important.\nThough it's not important, repeated Carton, in the same mechan-\nical waythough it's not importantNo, it's not important. No. Yet\nI know the face.\nI think not. I am sure not. It can't be, said the spy.\nIt-can't-be, muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling\nhis glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. Can't-be. Spoke\ngood French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\nProvincial, said the spy.\nNo. Foreign! cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table,\nas a light broke clearly on his mind. Cly! Disguised, but the same man.\nWe had that man before us at the Old Bailey.\nNow, there you are hasty, sir, said Barsad, with a smile that gave\nhis aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; there you really give\nme an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this\ndistance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I\nattended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church\nof Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard\nmultitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I\nhelped to lay him in his cof\u0002n.\nHere, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remark-\nable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered\nit to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the\nrisen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.\nLet us be reasonable, said the spy, and let us be fair. To show\nyou how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours\nis, I will lay before you a certi\u0002cate of Cly's burial, which I happened to\nhave carried in my pocket-book, with a hurried hand he produced and\nopened it, ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may\ntake it in your hand; it's no forgery.\nHere, Mr. Lorry perceived the re\u0003ection on the wall to elongate, and\nMr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been\nmore violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow\nwith the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.\nUnseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him\non the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\nThat there Roger Cly, master, said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn\nand iron-bound visage. So you put him in his cof\u0002n?\nI did.\nWho took him out of it?\nBarsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, What do you\nmean?\nI mean, said Mr. Cruncher, that he warn't never in it. No! Not\nhe! I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\nThe spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in\nunspeakable astonishment at Jerry.\nI tell you, said Jerry, that you buried paving-stones and earth in\nthat there cof\u0002n. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take\nin. Me and two more knows it.\nHow do you know it?\nWhat's that to you? Ecod! growled Mr. Cruncher, it's you I\nhave got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon\ntradesmen! I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a\nguinea.\nSydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at\nthis turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and\nexplain himself.\nAt another time, sir, he returned, evasively, the present time is\nill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well\nwot that there Cly was never in that there cof\u0002n. Let him say he was,\nin so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his\nthroat and choke him for half a guinea; Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this\nas quite a liberal offer; or I'll out and announce him.\nHumph! I see one thing, said Carton. I hold another card, Mr.\nBarsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion \u0002lling the air,\nfor you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with\nanother aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, more-\nover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to\nlife again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic.\nA strong carda certain Guillotine card! Do you play?\nNo! returned the spy. I throw up. I confess that we were so\nunpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England\nat the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up\nand down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.\nThough how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to\nme.\nNever you trouble your head about this man, retorted the con-\ntentious Mr. Cruncher; you'll have trouble enough with giving your at-\ntention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!Mr. Cruncher\ncould not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of\nhis liberalityI'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a\nguinea.\nThe Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and\nsaid, with more decision, It has come to a point. I go on duty soon,\nand can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is\nit? Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything\nin my of\u0002ce, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better\ntrust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In\nshort, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all\ndesperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I\ncan swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what\ndo you want with me?\nNot very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?\nI tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,\nsaid the spy, \u0002rmly.\nWhy need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at\nthe Conciergerie?\nI am sometimes.\nYou can be when you choose?\nI can pass in and out when I choose.\nSydney Carton \u0002lled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out\nupon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he said,\nrising:\nSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well\nthat the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.\nCome into the dark room here, and let us have one \u0002nal word alone.", "index": 37}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 9, "chapter_title": "The Game Made", "chapter_text": "While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the ad-\njoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.\nLorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest\ntradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire con\u0002dence; he\nchanged the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had \u0002fty of those\nlimbs, and were trying them all; he examined his \u0002nger-nails with a\nvery questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye\ncaught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requir-\ning the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to\nbe an in\u0002rmity attendant on perfect openness of character.\nJerry, said Mr. Lorry. Come here.\nMr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in\nadvance of him.\nWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\nAfter some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his pa-\ntron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, Agicul-\ntooral character.\nMy mind misgives me much, said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a\nfore\u0002nger at him, that you have used the respectable and great house\nof Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of\nan infamous description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you\nwhen you get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep\nyour secret. Tellson's shall not be imposed upon.\nI hope, sir, pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, that a gentleman\nlike yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,\nwould think twice about harming of me, even if it wos soI don't say\nit is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if\nit wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides\nto it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking\nup their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardens\nfardens! no, nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens! no, nor yet his\nquartera banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking their\nmedical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to\ntheir own carriagesah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that\n'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the goose and\nnot the gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old\nEngland times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a \u0003oppin' again\nthe business to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating! Whereas\nthem medical doctors' wives don't \u0003opcatch 'em at it! Or, if they \u0003op,\ntheir toppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly\nhave one without t'other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with\nparish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen\n(all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get much by it, even if it\nwos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him,\nMr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want all along to be out\nof the line, if he, could see his way out, being once ineven if it wos\nso.\nUgh! cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, I am\nshocked at the sight of you.\nNow, what I would humbly offer to you, sir, pursued Mr.\nCruncher, even if it wos so, which I don't say it is\nDon't prevaricate, said Mr. Lorry.\nNo, I will not, sir, returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were fur-\nther from his thoughts or practicewhich I don't say it iswot I\nwould humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool,\nat that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed\nup to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job\nyou, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes.\nIf it wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to\nyou, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of his\nmother; don't blow upon that boy's fatherdo not do it, sirand let\nthat father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends for\nwhat he would have undugif it wos so-by diggin' of 'em in with a will,\nand with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe. That, Mr.\nLorry, said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an an-\nnouncement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, is\nwot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't see all this here\na goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads,\ndear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and\nhardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of things. And these\nhere would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind\nthat wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might\nhave kep' it back.\nThat at least is true, said Mr. Lorry. Say no more now. It may\nbe that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in\nactionnot in words. I want no more words.\nMr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy\nreturned from the dark room. Adieu, Mr. Barsad, said the former;\nour arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.\nHe sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When\nthey were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\nNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured\naccess to him, once.\nMr. Lorry's countenance fell.\nIt is all I could do, said Carton. To propose too much, would be\nto put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing\nworse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the\nweakness of the position. There is no help for it.\nBut access to him, said Mr. Lorry, if it should go ill before the\nTribunal, will not save him.\nI never said it would.\nMr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the \u0002re; his sympathy with his\ndarling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually\nweakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of\nlate, and his tears fell.\nYou are a good man and a true friend, said Carton, in an altered\nvoice. Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see\nmy father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sor-\nrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,\nhowever.\nThough he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner,\nthere was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,\nthat Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly\nunprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.\nTo return to poor Darnay, said Carton. Don't tell Her of this\ninterview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see\nhim. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey\nto him the means of anticipating the sentence.\nMr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton\nto see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and\nevidently understood it.\nShe might think a thousand things, Carton said, and any of them\nwould only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to\nyou when I \u0002rst came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to\ndo any little helpful work for her that my hand can \u0002nd to do, without\nthat. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\nI am going now, directly.\nI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and\nreliance on you. How does she look?\nAnxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.\nAh!\nIt was a long, grieving sound, like a sighalmost like a sob. It\nattracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the\n\u0002re. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),\npassed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a\nwild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little \u0003am-\ning logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\nand top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the \u0002re touching their\nlight surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all\nuntrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to \u0002re was suf-\n\u0002ciently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\nhis boot was still upon the hot embers of the \u0003aming log, when it had\nbroken under the weight of his foot.\nI forgot it, he said.\nMr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the\nwasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having\nthe expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly\nreminded of that expression.\nAnd your duties here have drawn to an end, sir? said Carton,\nturning to him.\nYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unex-\npectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left\nthem in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave\nto Pass. I was ready to go.\nThey were both silent.\nYours is a long life to look back upon, sir? said Carton, wistfully.\nI am in my seventy-eighth year.\nYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;\ntrusted, respected, and looked up to?\nI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. indeed,\nI may say that I was a man of business when a boy.\nSee what a place you \u0002ll at seventy-eight. How many people will\nmiss you when you leave it empty!\nA solitary old bachelor, answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.\nThere is nobody to weep for me.\nHow can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her\nchild?\nYes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said.\nIt is a thing to thank God for; is it not?\nSurely, surely.\nIf you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, 'I\nhave secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect,\nof no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard;\nI have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!' your\nseventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they\nnot?\nYou say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.\nSydney turned his eyes again upon the \u0002re, and, after a silence of a\nfew moments, said:\nI should like to ask you:Does your childhood seem far off? Do\nthe days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long\nago?\nResponding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\nTwenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\ncloser and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to\nthe beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings\nof the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had\nlong fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by\nmany associations of the days when what we call the World was not so\nreal with me, and my faults were not con\u0002rmed in me.\nI understand the feeling! exclaimed Carton, with a bright \u0003ush.\nAnd you are the better for it?\nI hope so.\nCarton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on\nwith his outer coat; But you, said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme,\nyou are young.\nYes, said Carton. I am not old, but my young way was never the\nway to age. Enough of me.\nAnd of me, I am sure, said Mr. Lorry. Are you going out?\nI'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\nhabits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy;\nI shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?\nYes, unhappily.\nI shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will \u0002nd a\nplace for me. Take my arm, sir.\nMr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets.\nA few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left\nhim there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\nagain when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\nthe prison every day. She came out here, he said, looking about him,\nturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in\nher steps.\nIt was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La\nForce, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer,\nhaving closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\nGood night, citizen, said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for,\nthe man eyed him inquisitively.\nGood night, citizen.\nHow goes the Republic?\nYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall\nmount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes,\nof being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a\nBarber!\nDo you often go to see him\nShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at\nwork?\nNever.\nGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\ncitizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less\nthan two pipes. Word of honour!\nAs the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to\nexplain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising\ndesire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.\nBut you are not English, said the wood-sawyer, though you wear\nEnglish dress?\nYes, said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\nYou speak like a Frenchman.\nI am an old student here.\nAha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.\nGood night, citizen.\nBut go and see that droll dog, the little man persisted, calling after\nhim. And take a pipe with you!\nSydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle\nof the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on\na scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who\nremembered the way well, several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier\nthan usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in\nthose times of terrorhe stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner\nwas closing with his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a\ntortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.\nGiving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\ncounter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. Whew! the chemist\nwhistled softly, as he read it. Hi! hi! hi!\nSydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:\nFor you, citizen?\nFor me.\nYou will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the\nconsequences of mixing them?\nPerfectly.\nCertain small packets were made and given to him. He put them,\none by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for\nthem, and deliberately left the shop. There is nothing more to do,\nsaid he, glancing upward at the moon, until to-morrow. I can't sleep.\nIt was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these\nwords aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\nnegligence than de\u0002ance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\nhad wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\nhis road and saw its end.\nLong ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors\nas a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave.\nHis mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had\nbeen read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the\ndark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds\nsailing on high above him. I am the resurrection and the life, saith the\nLord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\nand whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.\nIn a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow\nrising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,\nand for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,\nand still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that\nbrought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,\nmight have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and\nwent on.\nWith a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were\ngoing to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors sur-\nrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were\nsaid, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-\ndestruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and pro\u0003igates;\nin the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for\nEternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which\nthe sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material,\nthat no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people\nout of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the\nwhole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause\nin fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.\nFew coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be\nsuspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy\nshoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well \u0002lled, and the people\npoured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of\nthe theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way\nacross the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before,\nthe timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.\nI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\nin me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\nbelieveth in me, shall never die.\nNow, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words\nwere in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and\nsteady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he\nheard them always.\nThe night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to\nthe water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the\npicturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light\nof the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.\nThen, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and\nfor a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death's\ndominion.\nBut, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that\nburden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright\nrays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of\nlight appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river\nsparkled under it.\nThe strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial\nfriend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the\nhouses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.\nWhen he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer,\nwatching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream\nabsorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.Like me.\nA trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then\nglided into his view, \u0003oated by him, and died away. As its silent track in\nthe water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart\nfor a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended\nin the words, I am the resurrection and the life.\nMr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to sur-\nmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing\nbut a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to\nrefresh himself, went out to the place of trial.\nThe court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheepwhom\nmany fell away from in dreadpressed him into an obscure corner\namong the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there.\nShe was there, sitting beside her father.\nWhen her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so\nsustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tender-\nness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into\nhis face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been\nany eyes to notice the in\u0003uence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would\nhave been seen to be the same in\u0003uence exactly.\nBefore that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,\nensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could\nhave been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had\nnot \u0002rst been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the\nRevolution was to scatter them all to the winds.\nEvery eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots\nand good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow\nand the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a\ncraving face, and his \u0002ngers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose\nappearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,\ncannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. An-\ntoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.\nEvery eye then turned to the \u0002ve judges and the public prosecutor.\nNo favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,\nmurderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other\neye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at\none another, before bending forward with a strained attention.\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused\nand retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected\nand Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of\ntyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished\nprivileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,\ncalled Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.\nTo this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.\nThe President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?\nOpenly, President.\nBy whom?\nThree voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.\nGood.\nTherese Defarge, his wife.\nGood.\nAlexandre Manette, physician.\nA great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doc-\ntor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been\nseated.\nPresident, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a\nfraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My\ndaughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who\nand where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband\nof my child!\nCitizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority\nof the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is\ndearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the\nRepublic.\nLoud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell,\nand with warmth resumed.\nIf the Republic should demand of you the sacri\u0002ce of your child\nherself, you would have no duty but to sacri\u0002ce her. Listen to what is\nto follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!\nFrantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,\nwith his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew\ncloser to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,\nand restored the usual hand to his mouth.\nDefarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of\nhis being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment,\nand of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the\nrelease, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to\nhim. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its\nwork.\nYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\nI believe so.\nHere, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: You were one\nof the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannoneer that\nday there, and you were among the \u0002rst to enter the accursed fortress\nwhen it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!\nIt was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the\naudience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but,\nThe Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, I defy that\nbell! wherein she was likewise much commended.\nInform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,\ncitizen.\nI knew, said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the\nbottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;\nI knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been con\u0002ned in a cell\nknown as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself.\nHe knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North\nTower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day,\nI resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount\nto the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a\ngaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone\nhas been worked out and replaced, I \u0002nd a written paper. This is that\nwritten paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of\nthe writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.\nI con\u0002de this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of\nthe President.\nLet it be read.\nIn a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking lov-\ningly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solici-\ntude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes \u0002xed on the reader,\nMadame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never tak-\ning his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon\nthe Doctor, who saw none of themthe paper was read, as follows.", "index": 38}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 10, "chapter_title": "The Substance of the Shadow", "chapter_text": "I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and\nafterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful\ncell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at\nstolen intervals, under every dif\u0002culty. I design to secrete it in the wall\nof the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of\nconcealment for it. Some pitying hand may \u0002nd it there, when I and my\nsorrows are dust.\nThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I\nwrite with dif\u0002culty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney,\nmixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.\nHope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings\nI have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired,\nbut I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right\nmindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that I write\nthe truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether\nthey be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.\nOne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I\nthink the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walk-\ning on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of\nthe frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the\nStreet of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind\nme, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, appre-\nhensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the\nwindow, and a voice called to the driver to stop.\nThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,\nand the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage\nwas then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open\nthe door and alight before I came up with it.\nI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to\nconceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,\nI also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather\nyounger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and\n(as far as I could see) face too.\n `You are Doctor Manette?' said one.\nI am.\n `Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; `the young\nphysician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two\nhas made a rising reputation in Paris?'\n `Gentlemen,' I returned, `I am that Doctor Manette of whom you\nspeak so graciously.'\n `We have been to your residence,' said the \u0002rst, `and not being so\nfortunate as to \u0002nd you there, and being informed that you were prob-\nably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking\nyou. Will you please to enter the carriage?'\nThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these\nwords were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the car-\nriage door. They were armed. I was not.\n `Gentlemen,' said I, `pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me\nthe honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to\nwhich I am summoned.'\nThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doc-\ntor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,\nour con\u0002dence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for your-\nself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the\ncarriage?'\nI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They\nboth entered after methe last springing in, after putting up the steps.\nThe carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.\nI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt\nthat it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it\ntook place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where\nI make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and\nput my paper in its hiding-place.\n* * * *\nThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and\nemerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the\nBarrierI did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards\nwhen I traversed itit struck out of the main avenue, and presently\nstopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a\ndamp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had over-\n\u0003owed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in\nanswer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck\nthe man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.\nThere was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,\nfor I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But,\nthe other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner\nwith his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly\nalike, that I then \u0002rst perceived them to be twin brothers.\nFrom the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found\nlocked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and\nhad relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I\nwas conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we\nascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,\nlying on a bed.\nThe patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly\nnot much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms\nwere bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that\nthese bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them,\nwhich was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial\nbearings of a Noble, and the letter E.\nI saw this, within the \u0002rst minute of my contemplation of the pa-\ntient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the\nedge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and\nwas in danger of suffocation. My \u0002rst act was to put out my hand to\nrelieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in\nthe corner caught my sight.\nI turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm\nher and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated\nand wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the\nwords, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up\nto twelve, and said, `Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she would\npause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and\nshe would repeat the cry, `My husband, my father, and my brother!'\nand would count up to twelve, and say, `Hush!' There was no variation\nin the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular\nmoment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds.\n `How long,' I asked, `has this lasted?'\nTo distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the\nyounger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority.\nIt was the elder who replied, `Since about this hour last night.'\n `She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'\n `A brother.'\n `I do not address her brother?'\nHe answered with great contempt, `No.'\n `She has some recent association with the number twelve?'\nThe younger brother impatiently rejoined, `With twelve o'clock?'\n `See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast,\n'how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was\ncoming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost.\nThere are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'\nThe elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, `There\nis a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on\nthe table.\n* * * *\nI opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to\nmy lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that\nwere poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.\n `Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.\n `You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no\nmore.\nI made the patient swallow, with great dif\u0002culty, and after many\nefforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after a\nwhile, and as it was necessary to watch its in\u0003uence, I then sat down by\nthe side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in atten-\ndance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner.\nThe house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnishedevidently,\nrecently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had\nbeen nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.\nThey continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry,\n`My husband, my father, and my brother!' the counting up to twelve,\nand `Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the\nbandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that\nthey were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case,\nwas, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing\nin\u0003uence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the \u0002gure. It had no\neffect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.\nFor the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by\nthe side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,\nbefore the elder said:\n `There is another patient.'\nI was startled, and asked, `Is it a pressing case?'\n `You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.\n* * * *\nThe other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase,\nwhich was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered\nceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof,\nand there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion\nof the place, fagots for \u0002ring, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass\nthrough that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and\nunshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell\nin the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw\nthem all that night.\nOn some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head,\nlay a handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the\nmost. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on\nhis breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see\nwhere his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could\nsee that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.\n `I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. `Let me examine it.'\n `I do not want it examined,' he answered; `let it be.'\nIt was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand\naway. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-\nfour hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been\nlooked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to\nthe elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose\nlife was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit;\nnot at all as if he were a fellow-creature.\n `How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.\n `A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw\nupon him, and has fallen by my brother's swordlike a gentleman.'\nThere was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this\nanswer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to\nhave that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have\nbeen better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin\nkind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the\nboy, or about his fate.\nThe boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and\nthey now slowly moved to me.\n `Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs\nare proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill\nus; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. Shehave you seen her,\nDoctor?'\nThe shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by\nthe distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.\nI said, `I have seen her.'\n `She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these\nNobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we\nhave had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say\nso. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too:\na tenant of his. We were all tenants of histhat man's who stands there.\nThe other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.'\nIt was with the greatest dif\u0002culty that the boy gathered bodily force\nto speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.\n `We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we com-\nmon dogs are by those superior Beingstaxed by him without mercy,\nobliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his\nmill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and\nforbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged\nand plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of\nmeat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed,\nthat his people should not see it and take it from usI say, we were so\nrobbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it\nwas a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we\nshould most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our\nmiserable race die out!'\nI had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth\nlike a \u0002re. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere;\nbut, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.\n `Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that\ntime, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and\ncomfort him in our cottageour dog-hut, as that man would call it.\nShe had not been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw\nher and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to himfor what\nare husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good\nand virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.\nWhat did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his in\u0003uence\nwith her, to make her willing?'\nThe boy's eyes, which had been \u0002xed on mine, slowly turned to\nthe looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The\ntwo opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in\nthis Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasants, all\ntrodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.\n `You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to\nharness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him\nand drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in\ntheir grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep\nmay not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at\nnight, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not\npersuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feedif he\ncould \u0002nd foodhe sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the\nbell, and died on her bosom.'\nNothing human could have held life in the boy but his determina-\ntion to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of\ndeath, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to\ncover his wound.\n `Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his\nbrother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told\nhis brotherand what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor,\nif it is nowhis brother took her awayfor his pleasure and diversion,\nfor a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the tid-\nings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that\n\u0002lled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond\nthe reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be his vassal.\nThen, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed ina common\ndog, but sword in hand.Where is the loft window? It was somewhere\nhere?'\nThe room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing\naround him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were\ntrampled over the \u0003oor, as if there had been a struggle.\n `She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he\nwas dead. He came in and \u0002rst tossed me some pieces of money; then\nstruck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at\nhim as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will,\nthe sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend\nhimselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life.'\nMy glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments\nof a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentle-\nman's. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a\nsoldier's.\n `Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'\n `He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he\nreferred to the brother.\n `He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the\nman who was here? turn my face to him.'\nI did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested\nfor the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely:\nobliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.\n `Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide,\nand his right hand raised, `in the days when all these things are to be\nanswered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to\nanswer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I\ndo it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon\nyour brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I\nmark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.'\nTwice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his\nfore\u0002nger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the \u0002nger\nyet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down\ndead.\n* * * *\nWhen I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her\nraving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might\nlast for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the\ngrave.\nI repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of\nthe bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing\nquality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of\nher words. They were always `My husband, my father, and my brother!\nOne, two, three, four, \u0002ve, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.\nHush!'\nThis lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I \u0002rst saw her. I\nhad come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began\nto falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and\nby-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.\nIt was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and\nfearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me\nto compose her \u0002gure and the dress she had to. It was then that I knew\nher condition to be that of one in whom the \u0002rst expectations of being a\nmother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had\nof her.\n `Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the\nelder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.\n `Not dead,' said I; `but like to die.'\n `What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking\ndown at her with some curiosity.\n `There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, `in sorrow and de-\nspair.'\nHe \u0002rst laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He\nmoved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away,\nand said in a subdued voice,\n `Doctor, \u0002nding my brother in this dif\u0002culty with these hinds, I rec-\nommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and,\nas a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful\nof your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and\nnot spoken of.'\nI listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.\n `Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'\n `Monsieur,' said I, `in my profession, the communications of pa-\ntients are always received in con\u0002dence.' I was guarded in my answer,\nfor I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.\nHer breathing was so dif\u0002cult to trace, that I carefully tried the\npulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I\nresumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.\n* * * *\nI write with so much dif\u0002culty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful\nof being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total dark-\nness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure\nin my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever\nspoken between me and those brothers.\nShe lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some\nfew syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She\nasked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It\nwas in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her\nhead upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.\nI had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the\nbrothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then,\nthough no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman\nand myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the\ncurtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to\nthat, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her;\nas ifthe thought passed through my mindI were dying too.\nI always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger\nbrother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that\npeasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind\nof either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading\nto the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger\nbrother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,\nfor knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more\npolite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an\nincumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.\nMy patient died, two hours before midnightat a time, by my\nwatch, answering almost to the minute when I had \u0002rst seen her. I was\nalone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one\nside, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.\nThe brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride\naway. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with\ntheir riding-whips, and loitering up and down.\n `At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.\n `She is dead,' said I.\n `I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned\nround.\nHe had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.\nHe now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it\non the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept\nnothing.\n `Pray excuse me,' said I. `Under the circumstances, no.'\nThey exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine\nto them, and we parted without another word on either side.\n* * * *\nI am weary, weary, weary-worn down by misery. I cannot read\nwhat I have written with this gaunt hand.\nEarly in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a\nlittle box, with my name on the outside. From the \u0002rst, I had anxiously\nconsidered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately\nto the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been\nsummoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all\nthe circumstances. I knew what Court in\u0003uence was, and what the\nimmunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would\nnever be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the\nmatter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved\nto state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger;\nbut I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were\ncompromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.\nI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that\nnight. I rose long before my usual time next morning to \u0002nish it. It was\nthe last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed,\nwhen I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.\n* * * *\nI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.\nIt is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon\nme is so dreadful.\nThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for\nlong life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the\nwife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the\nboy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered\non the scarf, and had no dif\u0002culty in arriving at the conclusion that I\nhad seen that nobleman very lately.\nMy memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our\nconversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and\nI know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected,\nand in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's\nshare in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was\ndead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in\nsecret, a woman's sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of\nHeaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.\nShe had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living,\nand her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing\nbut that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her\ninducement to come to me, relying on my con\u0002dence, had been the\nhope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this\nwretched hour I am ignorant of both.\n* * * *\nThese scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a\nwarning, yesterday. I must \u0002nish my record to-day.\nShe was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her mar-\nriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and\nhis in\u0003uence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in\ndread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there\nwas a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.\n `For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, `I would\ndo all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper\nin his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other in-\nnocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.\nWhat I have left to call my ownit is little beyond the worth of a few\njewelsI will make it the \u0002rst charge of his life to bestow, with the com-\npassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the\nsister can be discovered.'\nShe kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, `It is for thine own\ndear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her\nbravely, `Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and\nwent away caressing him. I never saw her more.\nAs she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew\nit, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not\ntrusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.\nThat night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man\nin a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly fol-\nlowed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant\ncame into the room where I sat with my wifeO my wife, beloved of\nmy heart! My fair young English wife!we saw the man, who was\nsupposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.\nAn urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain\nme, he had a coach in waiting.\nIt brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear\nof the house, a black muf\u0003er was drawn tightly over my mouth from\nbehind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road\nfrom a dark corner, and identi\u0002ed me with a single gesture. The Marquis\ntook from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in\nthe light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his\nfoot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my\nliving grave.\nIf it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the\nbrothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dear-\nest wifeso much as to let me know by a word whether alive or deadI\nmight have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now\nI believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they\nhave no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the\nlast of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last\nnight of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times\nwhen all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven\nand to earth.\nA terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done.\nA sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but\nblood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,\nand there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.\nLittle need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show\nhow the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other cap-\ntured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding\ntheir time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long\nbeen anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal\nregister. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would\nhave sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.\nAnd all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was\na well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.\nOne of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of\nthe questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacri\u0002ces and self-\nimmolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President said\n(else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physi-\ncian of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by root-\ning out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel\na sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child\nan orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of\nhuman sympathy.\nMuch in\u0003uence around him, has that Doctor? murmured\nMadame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. Save him now, my Doc-\ntor, save him!\nAt every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another.\nRoar and roar.\nUnanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an en-\nemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People.

But, she uttered no\nsound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was\nshe of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment\nit, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.\nThe Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of\ndoors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the\ncourt's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie\nstood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her\nface but love and consolation.\nIf I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens,\nif you would have so much compassion for us!\nThere was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had\ntaken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the\nshow in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, Let her embrace him\nthen; it is but a moment. It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed\nher over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over\nthe dock, could fold her in his arms.\nFarewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love.\nWe shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!\nThey were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.\nI can bear it, dear Charles.

A moment! He was tearing himself apart from\nher. We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart\nby-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her,\nGod will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.\nHer father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to\nboth of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:\nNo, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should\nkneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know,\nnow what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when\nyou knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against,\nand conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts,\nand all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!\nHer father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white\nhair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.\nIt could not be otherwise, said the prisoner. All things have\nworked together as they have fallen out. it was the always-vain en-\ndeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that \u0002rst brought my fatal\npresence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end\nwas not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive\nme. Heaven bless you!\nAs he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking\nafter him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer,\nand with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a com-\nforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her\nhead lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his\nfeet.\nThen, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never\nmoved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr.\nLorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported\nher head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat\nhad a \u0003ush of pride in it.\nShall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.\nHe carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a\ncoach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat\nbeside the driver.\nWhen they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark\nnot many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough\nstones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried\nher up the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch,\nwhere her child and Miss Pross wept over her.\nDon't recall her to herself, he said, softly, to the latter, she is\nbetter so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\nOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton! cried little Lucie, springing\nup and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.\nNow that you have come, I think you will do something to help\nmamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can\nyou, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\nHe bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.\nHe put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.\nBefore I go, he said, and pausedI may kiss her?\nIt was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched\nher face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was\nnearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when\nshe was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, A life you love.\nWhen he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on\nMr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:\nYou had great in\u0003uence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at\nleast be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly\nto you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\nNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the\nstrongest assurances that I should save him; and I did. He returned the\nanswer in great trouble, and very slowly.\nTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon\nare few and short, but try.\nI intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\nThat's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things\nbefore nowthough never, he added, with a smile and a sigh together,\nsuch great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we\nmisuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it\nwere not.\nI will go, said Doctor Manette, to the Prosecutor and the Presi-\ndent straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I\nwill write too, andBut stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and\nno one will be accessible until dark.\nThat's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much\nthe forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you\nspeed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have\nseen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?\nImmediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from\nthis.\nIt will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I\ngo to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from\nour friend or from yourself?\nYes.\nMay you prosper!\nMr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on\nthe shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.\nI have no hope, said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.\nNor have I.\nIf any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare\nhimwhich is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's to\nthem!I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the\ncourt.\nAnd so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.\nMr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face\nupon it.\nDon't despond, said Carton, very gently; don't grieve. I encour-\naged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be\nconsolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think `his life was want only\nthrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her.\nYes, yes, yes, returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, you are right.\nBut he will perish; there is no real hope.\nYes. He will perish: there is no real hope, echoed Carton.\nAnd walked with a settled step, down-stairs.", "index": 40}

I think so. It is best that\nthese people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound\nprecaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!\nLet me think it out!\nChecking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he\ntook a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the\nthought in his mind to its possible consequences. His \u0002rst impression\nwas con\u0002rmed. It is best, he said, \u0002nally resolved, that these people\nshould know there is such a man as I here. And he turned his face\ntowards Saint Antoine.\nDefarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-\nshop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not dif\u0002cult for one who knew\nthe city well, to \u0002nd his house without asking any question. Having\nascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again,\nand dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner.\nFor the \u0002rst time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night\nhe had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had\ndropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who\nhad done with it.\nIt was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went\nout into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he\nstopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered\nthe disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and\nhis wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.\nThere happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of\nthe restless \u0002ngers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen\nupon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with\nthe Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation,\nlike a regular member of the establishment.\nAs Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent\nFrench) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless\nglance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced\nto him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.\nHe repeated what he had already said.\nEnglish? asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark\neyebrows.\nAfter looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word\nwere slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong\nforeign accent. Yes, madame, yes. I am English!\nMadame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he\ntook up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its\nmeaning, he heard her say, I swear to you, like Evremonde!\nDefarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.\nHow?\nGood evening.\nOh! Good evening, citizen, \u0002lling his glass. Ah! and good wine.\nI drink to the Republic.\nDefarge went back to the counter, and said, Certainly, a little like.\nMadame sternly retorted, I tell you a good deal like. Jacques Three\npaci\u0002cally remarked, He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.\nThe amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, Yes, my faith! And you\nare looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more\nto-morrow!\nCarton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow fore-\n\u0002nger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning\ntheir arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence\nof a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without\ndisturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed\ntheir conversation.\nIt is true what madame says, observed Jacques Three. Why stop?\nThere is great force in that. Why stop?\nWell, well, reasoned Defarge, but one must stop somewhere. Af-\nter all, the question is still where?\nAt extermination, said madame.\nMagni\u0002cent! croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly\napproved.\nExtermination is good doctrine, my wife, said Defarge, rather\ntroubled; in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suf-\nfered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when\nthe paper was read.\nI have observed his face! repeated madame, contemptuously and\nangrily. Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be\nnot the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his\nface!\nAnd you have observed, my wife, said Defarge, in a deprecatory\nmanner, the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish\nto him!\nI have observed his daughter, repeated madame; yes, I have ob-\nserved his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day,\nand I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court,\nand I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my\n\u0002nger! She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on his\npaper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the\naxe had dropped.\nThe citizeness is superb! croaked the Juryman.\nShe is an Angel! said The Vengeance, and embraced her.\nAs to thee, pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband,\nif it depended on theewhich, happily, it does notthou wouldst res-\ncue this man even now.\nNo! protested Defarge. Not if to lift this glass would do it! But\nI would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.\nSee you then, Jacques, said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; and\nsee you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other\ncrimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my\nregister, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is\nthat so.\nIt is so, assented Defarge, without being asked.\nIn the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he \u0002nds\nthis paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the\nnight when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by\nthe light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.\nIt is so, assented Defarge.\nThat night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the\nlamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and\nbetween those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask\nhim, is that so.\nIt is so, assented Defarge again.\nI communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these\ntwo hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, `Defarge, I was brought\nup among the \u0002shermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so\ninjured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes,\nis my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon\nthe ground was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that\nunborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father\nwas my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer\nfor those things descends to me!' Ask him, is that so.\nIt is so, assented Defarge once more.\nThen tell Wind and Fire where to stop, returned madame; but\ndon't tell me.\nBoth her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly na-\nture of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was, without\nseeing herand both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority,\ninterposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of\nthe Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last\nreply. Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!\nCustomers entered, and the group was broken up. The English\ncustomer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change,\nand asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace.\nMadame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in\npointing out the road. The English customer was not without his re\u0003ec-\ntions then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and\nstrike under it sharp and deep.\nBut, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of\nthe prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present\nhimself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman\nwalking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\nuntil just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\nkeep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted\nthe banking-house towards four o'clock. She had some faint hopes that\nhis mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had\nbeen more than \u0002ve hours gone: where could he be?\nMr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and\nhe being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he\nshould go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.\nIn the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the \u0002re for the Doctor.\nHe waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor\nManette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings\nof him, and brought none. Where could he be?\nThey were discussing this question, and were almost building up\nsome weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard\nhim on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all\nwas lost.\nWhether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all\nthat time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring\nat them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.\nI cannot \u0002nd it, said he, and I must have it. Where is it?\nHis head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\nstraying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the \u0003oor.\nWhere is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench,\nand I can't \u0002nd it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I\nmust \u0002nish those shoes.\nThey looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\nCome, come! said he, in a whimpering miserable way; let me get\nto work. Give me my work.\nReceiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the\nground, like a distracted child.\nDon't torture a poor forlorn wretch, he implored them, with a\ndreadful cry; but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those\nshoes are not done to-night?\nLost, utterly lost!\nIt was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore\nhim, thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder,\nand soothed him to sit down before the \u0002re, with a promise that he\nshould have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded\nover the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the\ngarret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him\nshrink into the exact \u0002gure that Defarge had had in keeping.\nAffected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spec-\ntacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely\ndaughter, bereft of her \u0002nal hope and reliance, appealed to them both\ntoo strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with\none meaning in their faces. Carton was the \u0002rst to speak:\nThe last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be\ntaken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend\nto me? Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make,\nand exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reasona good\none.\nI do not doubt it, answered Mr. Lorry. Say on.\nThe \u0002gure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously\nrocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as\nthey would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the\nnight.\nCarton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his\nfeet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to\ncarry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the \u0003oor. Carton took it\nup, and there was a folded paper in it. We should look at this! he said.\nMr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, Thank\nGod!\nWhat is it? asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.\nA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First, he put his hand\nin his coat, and took another paper from it, that is the certi\u0002cate which\nenables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You seeSydney Carton,\nan Englishman?\nMr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\nKeep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you\nremember, and I had better not take it into the prison.\nWhy not?\nI don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doc-\ntor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certi\u0002cate, enabling\nhim and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and\nthe frontier! You see?\nYes!\nPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against\nevil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don't stay to look; put\nit up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted\nuntil within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper.\nIt is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason\nto think, will be.\nThey are not in danger?\nThey are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by\nMadame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words\nof that woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in\nstrong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.\nHe con\u0002rms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison\nwall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by\nMadame Defarge as to his having seen Herhe never mentioned Lu-\ncie's namemaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee\nthat the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will\ninvolve her lifeand perhaps her child'sand perhaps her father'sfor\nboth have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horri\u0002ed. You\nwill save them all.\nHeaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\nI am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could\ndepend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not\ntake place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days\nafterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital\ncrime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She\nand her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this\nwoman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would\nwait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure.\nYou follow me?\nSo attentively, and with so much con\u0002dence in what you say, that\nfor the moment I lose sight, touching the back of the Doctor's chair,\neven of this distress.\nYou have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the sea-\ncoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have\nbeen completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow\nhave your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two\no'clock in the afternoon.\nIt shall be done!\nHis manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the\n\u0003ame, and was as quick as youth.\nYou are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better\nman? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving\nher child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own\nfair head beside her husband's cheerfully. He faltered for an instant;\nthen went on as before. For the sake of her child and her father, press\nupon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour.\nTell her that it was her husband's last arrangement. Tell her that more\ndepends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her\nfather, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?\nI am sure of it.\nI thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements\nmade in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in\nthe carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.\nI understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?\nYou have my certi\u0002cate in your hand with the rest, you know, and\nwill reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied,\nand then for England!\nWhy, then, said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so \u0002rm and\nsteady hand, it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a\nyoung and ardent man at my side.\nBy the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing\nwill in\u0003uence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to\none another.\nNothing, Carton.\nRemember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in\nitfor any reasonand no life can possibly be saved, and many lives\nmust inevitably be sacri\u0002ced.\nI will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.\nAnd I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!\nThough he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though\nhe even put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him\nthen. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking \u0002gure before the dying\nembers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth\nto \u0002nd where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly\nbesought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to\nthe courtyard of the house where the af\u0003icted heartso happy in the\nmemorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it\noutwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained\nthere for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of\nher room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and\na Farewell.", "index": 41}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 13, "chapter_title": "Fifty-two", "chapter_text": "In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited\ntheir fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two\nwere to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless\neverlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were\nappointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the\nblood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.\nTwo score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of sev-\nenty, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty,\nwhose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, en-\ngendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all\ndegrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,\nintolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally with-\nout distinction.\nCharles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no \u0003atter-\ning delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the\nnarrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully\ncomprehended that no personal in\u0003uence could possibly save him, that\nhe was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail\nhim nothing.\nNevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh\nbefore him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life\nwas strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and\ndegrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when\nhe brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was\nclosed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent\nand heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If,\nfor a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to\nlive after him, seemed to protest and to make it a sel\u0002sh thing.\nBut, all this was at \u0002rst. Before long, the consideration that there was\nno disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same\nroad wrongfully, and trod it \u0002rmly every day, sprang up to stimulate\nhim. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind\nenjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by\ndegrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts\nmuch higher, and draw comfort down.\nBefore it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had\ntravelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means\nof writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison\nlamps should be extinguished.\nHe wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known\nnothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from her-\nself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's\nresponsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had\nalready explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name\nhe had relinquished, was the one conditionfully intelligible nowthat\nher father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he\nhad still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for\nher father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become\noblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him\n(for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old\nSunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved\nany de\u0002nite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had\nsupposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention\nof it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered\nthere, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her\nthough he added that he knew it was needlessto console her father, by\nimpressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the\ntruth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach him-\nself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to\nher preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her over-\ncoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured\nher, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.\nTo her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her\nfather that he expressly con\u0002ded his wife and child to his care. And he\ntold him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any de-\nspondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might\nbe tending.\nTo Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly\naffairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship\nand warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His\nmind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.\nHe had time to \u0002nish these letters before the lights were put out.\nWhen he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this\nworld.\nBut, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining\nforms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had\nnothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of\nheart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and\nhe had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even\nsuffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there\nwas no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in\nthe sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened,\nuntil it \u0003ashed upon his mind, this is the day of my death!\nThus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the \u0002fty-two\nheads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that\nhe could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his\nwaking thoughts, which was very dif\u0002cult to master.\nHe had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How\nhigh it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be\nstood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be\ndyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the\n\u0002rst, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise\ndirected by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless\ntimes. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no\nfear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what\nto do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the\nfew swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like\nthe wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.\nThe hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the\nnumbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for\never, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard\ncontest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed\nhim, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly repeat-\ning their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could\nwalk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself\nand for them.\nTwelve gone for ever.\nHe had been apprised that the \u0002nal hour was Three, and he knew he\nwould be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted\nheavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep\nTwo before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the\ninterval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.\nWalking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a\nvery different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La\nForce, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour\nhad measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for\nhis recovered self-possession, he thought, There is but another now,\nand turned to walk again.\nFootsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.\nThe key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened,\nor as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: He has never\nseen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near.\nLose no time!\nThe door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before\nhim face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his\nfeatures, and a cautionary \u0002nger on his lip, Sydney Carton.\nThere was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for\nthe \u0002rst moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of\nhis own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the\nprisoner's hand, and it was his real grasp.\nOf all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me? he\nsaid.\nI could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now.\nYou are notthe apprehension came suddenly into his minda pris-\noner?\nNo. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers\nhere, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from heryour wife,\ndear Darnay.\nThe prisoner wrung his hand.\nI bring you a request from her.\nWhat is it?\nA most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you\nin the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well\nremember.\nThe prisoner turned his face partly aside.\nYou have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have\nno time to tell you. You must comply with ittake off those boots you\nwear, and draw on these of mine.\nThere was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.\nCarton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got\nhim down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.\nDraw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your\nwill to them. Quick!\nCarton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.\nYou will only die with me. It is madness.\nIt would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I\nask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here.\nChange that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While\nyou do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your\nhair like this of mine!\nWith wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and ac-\ntion, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon\nhim. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.\nCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished,\nit never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I\nimplore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\nDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,\nrefuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand\nsteady enough to write?\nIt was when you came in.\nSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend,\nquick!\nPressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the\ntable. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.\nWrite exactly as I speak.\nTo whom do I address it?\nTo no one. Carton still had his hand in his breast.\nDo I date it?\nNo.\nThe prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over\nhim with his hand in his breast, looked down.\n `If you remember,'  said Carton, dictating,  `the words that\npassed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when\nyou see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to\nforget them.' \nHe was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to\nlook up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing\nupon something.\nHave you written `forget them'? Carton asked.\nI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\nNo; I am not armed.\nWhat is it in your hand?\nYou shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.\nHe dictated again.  `I am thankful that the time has come, when I can\nprove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.'  As he said\nthese words with his eyes \u0002xed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly\nmoved down close to the writer's face.\nThe pen dropped from Darnay's \u0002ngers on the table, and he looked\nabout him vacantly.\nWhat vapour is that? he asked.\nVapour?\nSomething that crossed me?\nI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the\npen and \u0002nish. Hurry, hurry!\nAs if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the pris-\noner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton\nwith clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton\nhis hand again in his breastlooked steadily at him.\nHurry, hurry!\nThe prisoner bent over the paper, once more.\n `If it had been otherwise;'  Carton's hand was again watchfully\nand softly stealing down;  `I never should have used the longer oppor-\ntunity. If it had been otherwise;'  the hand was at the prisoner's face;\n `I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been\notherwise'  Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into\nunintelligible signs.\nCarton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner\nsprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and\n\u0002rm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.\nFor a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to\nlay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched\ninsensible on the ground.\nQuickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Car-\nton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed\nback his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then,\nhe softly called, Enter there! Come in! and the Spy presented himself.\nYou see? said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee\nbeside the insensible \u0002gure, putting the paper in the breast: is your\nhazard very great?\nMr. Carton, the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his \u0002ngers,\nmy hazard is not that, in the thick of business here, if you are true to\nthe whole of your bargain.\nDon't fear me. I will be true to the death.\nYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of \u0002fty-two is to be right. Being\nmade right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\nHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and\nthe rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and\ntake me to the coach.\nYou? said the Spy nervously.\nHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate\nby which you brought me in?\nOf course.\nI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter\nnow you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such\na thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your\nown hands. Quick! Call assistance!\nYou swear not to betray me? said the trembling Spy, as he paused\nfor a last moment.\nMan, man! returned Carton, stamping his foot; have I sworn\nby no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the\nprecious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know\nof, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry,\ntell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my\nwords of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!\nThe Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his\nforehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.\nHow, then? said one of them, contemplating the fallen \u0002gure. So\naf\u0003icted to \u0002nd that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte\nGuillotine?\nA good patriot, said the other, could hardly have been more af-\n\u0003icted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.\nThey raised the unconscious \u0002gure, placed it on a litter they had\nbrought to the door, and bent to carry it away.\nThe time is short, Evremonde, said the Spy, in a warning voice.\nI know it well, answered Carton. Be careful of my friend, I\nentreat you, and leave me.\nCome, then, my children, said Barsad. Lift him, and come\naway!\nThe door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of\nlistening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote sus-\npicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps\npassed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that\nseemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at\nthe table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.\nSounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\nbegan to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and \u0002-\nnally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying,\nFollow me, Evremonde! and he followed into a large dark room, at a\ndistance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within,\nand what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the\nothers who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were\nstanding; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;\nbut, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking\n\u0002xedly at the ground.\nAs he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the \u0002fty-\ntwo were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace\nhim, as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread\nof discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a\nyoung woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which\nthere was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes,\nrose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak\nto him.\nCitizen Evremonde, she said, touching him with her cold hand. I\nam a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.\nHe murmured for answer: True. I forget what you were accused\nof?\nPlots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is\nit likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature\nlike me?\nThe forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears\nstarted from his eyes.\nI am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.\nI am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good\nto us poor, will pro\u0002t by my death; but I do not know how that can be,\nCitizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!\nAs the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to,\nit warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.\nI heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was\ntrue?\nIt was. But, I was again taken and condemned.\nIf I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold\nyour hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give\nme more courage.\nAs the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in\nthem, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn\nyoung \u0002ngers, and touched his lips.\nAre you dying for him? she whispered.\nAnd his wife and child. Hush! Yes.\nO you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?\nHush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.\nThe same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that\nsame hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about\nit, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.\nWho goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!\nThe papers are handed out, and read.\nAlexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?\nThis is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old\nman pointed out.\nApparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The\nRevolution-fever will have been too much for him?\nGreatly too much for him.\nHah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is\nshe?\nThis is she.\nApparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?\nIt is.\nHah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child.\nEnglish. This is she?\nShe and no other.\nKiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Re-\npublican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton.\nAdvocate. English. Which is he?\nHe lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.\nApparently the English advocate is in a swoon?\nIt is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that\nhe is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is\nunder the displeasure of the Republic.\nIs that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the dis-\npleasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis\nLorry. Banker. English. Which is he?\nI am he. Necessarily, being the last.\nIt is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is\nJarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach\ndoor, replying to a group of of\u0002cials. They leisurely walk round the\ncarriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage\nit carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer\nto the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its\nmother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of\nan aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.\nBehold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.\nOne can depart, citizen?\nOne can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!\nI salute you, citizens.And the \u0002rst danger passed!\nThese are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and\nlooks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is\nthe heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.\nAre we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go\nfaster? asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.\nIt would seem like \u0003ight, my darling. I must not urge them too\nmuch; it would rouse suspicion.\nLook back, look back, and see if we are pursued!\nThe road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.\nHouses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous build-\nings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leaf-\nless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud\nis on either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid\nthe stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and\nsloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in\nour wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and runninghiding\ndoing anything but stopping.\nOut of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary\nfarms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,\navenues of lea\u0003ess trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back\nby another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,\nno. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!\nthe posting-house.\nLeisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands\nin the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of\never moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence,\none by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting\nthe lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money,\nmake wrong additions, and arrive at dissatis\u0002ed results. All the time,\nour overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the\nfastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.\nAt length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left\nbehind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and\non the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech\nwith animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on\ntheir haunches. We are pursued?\nHo! Within the carriage there. Speak then!\nWhat is it? asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.\nHow many did they say?\nI do not understand you.\nAt the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?\nFifty-two.\nI said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have\nit forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes\nhandsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!\nThe night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive,\nand to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,\nby his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help\nus! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.\nThe wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are \u0003ying after us, and\nthe moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of\nus; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.", "index": 42}
{"sub_book_number": "Third", "sub_book_title": "The Track of a Storm", "chapter_number": 14, "chapter_title": "The Knitting Done", "chapter_text": "In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate\nMadame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and\nJacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did\nMadame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the\nwood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not par-\nticipate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer\nsatellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion\nuntil invited.\nBut our Defarge, said Jacques Three, is undoubtedly a good Re-\npublican? Eh?\nThere is no better, the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill\nnotes, in France.\nPeace, little Vengeance, said Madame Defarge, laying her hand\nwith a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, hear me speak. My hus-\nband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has de-\nserved well of the Republic, and possesses its con\u0002dence. But my hus-\nband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this\nDoctor.\nIt is a great pity, croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his\nhead, with his cruel \u0002ngers at his hungry mouth; it is not quite like a\ngood citizen; it is a thing to regret.\nSee you, said madame, I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may\nwear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to\nme. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife\nand child must follow the husband and father.\nShe has a \u0002ne head for it, croaked Jacques Three. I have seen\nblue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Sam-\nson held them up. Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.\nMadame Defarge cast down her eyes, and re\u0003ected a little.\nThe child also, observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoy-\nment of his words, has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have\na child there. It is a pretty sight!\nIn a word, said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstrac-\ntion, I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since\nlast night, that I dare not con\u0002de to him the details of my projects; but\nalso I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then\nthey might escape.\nThat must never be, croaked Jacques Three; no one must escape.\nWe have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\nIn a word, Madame Defarge went on, my husband has not my\nreason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason\nfor regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\ntherefore. Come hither, little citizen.\nThe wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the\nsubmission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.\nTouching those signals, little citizen, said Madame Defarge,\nsternly, that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness\nto them this very day?\nAy, ay, why not! cried the sawyer. Every day, in all weathers,\nfrom two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, some-\ntimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\nHe made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental\nimitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never\nseen.\nClearly plots, said Jacques Three. Transparently!\nThere is no doubt of the Jury? inquired Madame Defarge, letting\nher eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.\nRely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-\nJurymen.\nNow, let me see, said Madame Defarge, pondering again. Yet\nonce more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling\neither way. Can I spare him?\nHe would count as one head, observed Jacques Three, in a low\nvoice. We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\nHe was signalling with her when I saw her, argued Madame De-\nfarge; I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent,\nand trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a\nbad witness.\nThe Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fer-\nvent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of\nwitnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a\ncelestial witness.\nHe must take his chance, said Madame Defarge. No, I cannot\nspare him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the\nbatch of to-day executed.You?\nThe question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly\nreplied in the af\u0002rmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the\nmost ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most des-\nolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the plea-\nsure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll\nnational barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might\nhave been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked con-\ntemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small\nindividual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.\nI, said madame, am equally engaged at the same place. After it\nis over-say at eight to-nightcome you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we\nwill give information against these people at my Section.\nThe wood-sawyer said he would be proud and \u0003attered to attend\nthe citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed,\nevaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his\nwood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.\nMadame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little\nnearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:\nShe will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She\nwill be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach\nthe justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.\nI will go to her.\nWhat an admirable woman; what an adorable woman! exclaimed\nJacques Three, rapturously. Ah, my cherished! cried The Vengeance;\nand embraced her.\nTake you my knitting, said Madame Defarge, placing it in her\nlieutenant's hands, and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep\nme my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a\ngreater concourse than usual, to-day.\nI willingly obey the orders of my Chief, said The Vengeance with\nalacrity, and kissing her cheek. You will not be late?\nI shall be there before the commencement.\nAnd before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,\nsaid The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into\nthe street, before the tumbrils arrive!\nMadame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard,\nand might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through\nthe mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and\nthe Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appre-\nciative of her \u0002ne \u0002gure, and her superb moral endowments.\nThere were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a\ndreadfully dis\u0002guring hand; but, there was not one among them more\nto be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the\nstreets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness,\nof great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to\nimpart to its possessor \u0002rmness and animosity, but to strike into others\nan instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would\nhave heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her\nchildhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of\na class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely\nwithout pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out\nof her.\nIt was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins\nof his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her,\nthat his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that\nwas insuf\u0002cient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\nher prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made\nhopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had\nbeen laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\nshe had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\nbeen ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\nsofter feeling than a \u0002erce desire to change places with the man who\nsent here there.\nSuch a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Care-\nlessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and\nher dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\nbosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\ndagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the con\u0002dent tread of such\na character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habit-\nually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown\nsea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.\nNow, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment\nwaiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\nthe dif\u0002culty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's\nattention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\nbut it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\nit and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape\nmight depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. Finally,\nhe had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry,\nwho were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in\nthe lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered\nwith luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and\npreceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly\nfacilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay\nwas the most to be dreaded.\nSeeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\npressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had be-\nheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\npassed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now conclud-\ning their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\ntaking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\nelse-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.\nNow what do you think, Mr. Cruncher, said Miss Pross, whose\nagitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move,\nor live: what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?\nAnother carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\nsuspicion.\nMy opinion, miss, returned Mr. Cruncher, is as you're right.\nLikewise wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong.\nI am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\nsaid Miss Pross, wildly crying, that I am incapable of forming any plan.\nAre you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?\nRespectin' a future spear o' life, miss, returned Mr. Cruncher, I\nhope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mind,\nI think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two\npromises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?\nOh, for gracious sake! cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying,\nrecord them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent\nman.\nFirst, said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke\nwith an ashy and solemn visage, them poor things well out o' this,\nnever no more will I do it, never no more!\nI am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher, returned Miss Pross, that you\nnever will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\nnecessary to mention more particularly what it is.\nNo, miss, returned Jerry, it shall not be named to you. Second:\nthem poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere\nwith Mrs. Cruncher's \u0003opping, never no more!\nWhatever housekeeping arrangement that may be, said Miss\nPross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, I have no doubt\nit is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\nsuperintendence.O my poor darlings!\nI go so far as to say, miss, moreover, proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with\na most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my\nwords be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourselfthat\nwot my opinions respectin' \u0003opping has undergone a change, and that\nwot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a \u0003opping\nat the present time.\nThere, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man, cried the dis-\ntracted Miss Pross, and I hope she \u0002nds it answering her expectations.\nForbid it, proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, ad-\nditional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out,\nas anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my\nearnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't\nall \u0003op (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal\nrisk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-bid it! This was Mr. Cruncher's\nconclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to \u0002nd a better one.\nAnd still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\nnearer and nearer.\nIf we ever get back to our native land, said Miss Pross, you may\nrely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to re-\nmember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at\nall events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thor-\noughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My\nesteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!\nStill, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\nnearer and nearer.\nIf you were to go before, said Miss Pross, and stop the vehi-\ncle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me;\nwouldn't that be best?\nMr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\nWhere could you wait for me? asked Miss Pross.\nMr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality\nbut Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and\nMadame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\nBy the cathedral door, said Miss Pross. Would it be much out of\nthe way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two\ntowers?\nNo, miss, answered Mr. Cruncher.\nThen, like the best of men, said Miss Pross, go to the posting-\nhouse straight, and make that change.\nI am doubtful, said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\nabout leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.\nHeaven knows we don't, returned Miss Pross, but have no fear\nfor me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as\nyou can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel\ncertain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of\nthe lives that may depend on both of us!\nThis exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised en-\ntreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or\ntwo, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by\nherself to follow as she had proposed.\nThe having originated a precaution which was already in course of\nexecution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing\nher appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets,\nwas another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes\npast two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\nAfraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\nrooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\nin them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\nwhich were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions,\nshe could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by\nthe dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that\nthere was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and\ncried out, for she saw a \u0002gure standing in the room.\nThe basin fell to the ground broken, and the water \u0003owed to the feet\nof Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining\nblood, those feet had come to meet that water.\nMadame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, The wife of Evre-\nmonde; where is she?\nIt \u0003ashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing\nopen, and would suggest the \u0003ight. Her \u0002rst act was to shut them. There\nwere four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself\nbefore the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\nMadame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid move-\nment, and rested on her when it was \u0002nished. Miss Pross had nothing\nbeautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the\ngrimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in\nher different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes,\nevery inch.\nYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer, said\nMiss Pross, in her breathing. Nevertheless, you shall not get the better\nof me. I am an Englishwoman.\nMadame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something\nof Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a\ntight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same\n\u0002gure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full\nwell that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew\nfull well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.\nOn my way yonder, said Madame Defarge, with a slight move-\nment of her hand towards the fatal spot, where they reserve my chair\nand my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in\npassing. I wish to see her.\nI know that your intentions are evil, said Miss Pross, and you\nmay depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.\nEach spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's\nwords; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and\nmanner, what the unintelligible words meant.\nIt will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\nmoment, said Madame Defarge. Good patriots will know what that\nmeans. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\nIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches, returned Miss Pross,\nand I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.\nNo, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\nMadame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks\nin detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set\nat naught.\nWoman imbecile and pig-like! said Madame Defarge, frowning.\nI take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I\ndemand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to\nher! This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\nI little thought, said Miss Pross, that I should ever want to un-\nderstand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except\nthe clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part\nof it.\nNeither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes.\nMadame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when\nMiss Pross \u0002rst became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\nI am a Briton, said Miss Pross, I am desperate. I don't care an\nEnglish Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here,\nthe greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of\nthat dark hair upon your head, if you lay a \u0002nger on me!\nThus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a \u0003ash of her eyes\nbetween every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\nThus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\nBut, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the\nirrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame De-\nfarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. Ha, ha! she\nlaughed, you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to\nthat Doctor. Then she raised her voice and called out, Citizen Doc-\ntor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this\nmiserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\nPerhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the\nexpression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\neither suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\nThree of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\nThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing,\nthere are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room\nbehind you! Let me look.\nNever! said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly\nas Madame Defarge understood the answer.\nIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\nbrought back, said Madame Defarge to herself.\nAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not,\nyou are uncertain what to do, said Miss Pross to herself; and you\nshall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that,\nor not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\nI have been in the streets from the \u0002rst, nothing has stopped me,\nI will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door, said\nMadame Defarge.\nWe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard,\nwe are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep\nyou here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand\nguineas to my darling, said Miss Pross.\nMadame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of\nthe moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her\ntight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss\nPross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than\nhate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the \u0003oor in the struggle\nthat they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore\nher face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist,\nand clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.\nSoon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encir-\ncled waist. It is under my arm, said Miss Pross, in smothered tones,\nyou shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I\nhold you till one or other of us faints or dies!\nMadame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up,\nsaw what it was, struck at it, struck out a \u0003ash and a crash, and stood\naloneblinded with smoke.\nAll this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful\nstillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman\nwhose body lay lifeless on the ground.\nIn the \u0002rst fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the\nbody as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for\nfruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of\nwhat she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to\ngo in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get\nthe bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out\non the staircase, \u0002rst shutting and locking the door and taking away the\nkey. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to\ncry, and then got up and hurried away.\nBy good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly\nhave gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune,\ntoo, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show dis\u0002g-\nurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the\nmarks of gripping \u0002ngers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn,\nand her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and\ndragged a hundred ways.\nIn crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriv-\ning at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting\nthere, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if\nit were identi\u0002ed, what if the door were opened and the remains discov-\nered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged\nwith murder! In the midst of these \u0003uttering thoughts, the escort ap-\npeared, took her in, and took her away.\nIs there any noise in the streets? she asked him.\nThe usual noises, Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by\nthe question and by her aspect.\nI don't hear you, said Miss Pross. What do you say?\nIt was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross\ncould not hear him. So I'll nod my head, thought Mr. Cruncher,\namazed, at all events she'll see that. And she did.\nIs there any noise in the streets now? asked Miss Pross again,\npresently.\nAgain Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\nI don't hear it.\nGone deaf in an hour? said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his\nmind much disturbed; wot's come to her?\nI feel, said Miss Pross, as if there had been a \u0003ash and a crash,\nand that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\nBlest if she ain't in a queer condition! said Mr. Cruncher, more\nand more disturbed. Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her\ncourage up? Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can\nhear that, miss?\nI can hear, said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, nothing.\nO, my good man, there was \u0002rst a great crash, and then a great still-\nness, and that stillness seems to be \u0002xed and unchangeable, never to be\nbroken any more as long as my life lasts.\nIf she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh\ntheir journey's end, said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, it's\nmy opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.\nAnd indeed she never did.", "index": 43}

Six\ntumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and\ninsatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are\nfused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France,\nwith its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a\npeppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain\nthan those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape\nonce more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same\ntortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression\nover again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.\nSix tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what\nthey were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be\nthe carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the\ntoilettes of \u0003aring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house\nbut dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the\ngreat magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the\nCreator, never reverses his transformations. If thou be changed into\nthis shape by the will of God, say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise\nArabian stories, then remain so! But, if thou wear this form through\nmere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect! Changeless\nand hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.\nAs the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough\nup a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of\nfaces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily on-\nward. So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle,\nthat in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation\nof the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the\nfaces in the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the\nsight; then he points his \u0002nger, with something of the complacency of\na curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to\ntell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.\nOf the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\nthings on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a\nlingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with droop-\ning heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of\ntheir looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have\nseen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes, and think, or\ntry to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and he a miserable\ncreature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror,\nthat he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole number appeals\nby look or gesture, to the pity of the people.\nThere is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,\nand faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked\nsome question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it\nis always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The\nhorsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\ntheir swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\nat the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a\nmere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no\ncuriosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl.\nHere and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against\nhim. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his\nhair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face,\nhis arms being bound.\nOn the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils,\nstands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the \u0002rst of them: not\nthere. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself,\nHas he sacri\u0002ced me? when his face clears, as he looks into the third.\nWhich is Evremonde? says a man behind him.\nThat. At the back there.\nWith his hand in the girl's?\nYes.\nThe man cries, Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!\nDown, Evremonde!\nHush, hush! the Spy entreats him, timidly.\nAnd why not, citizen?\nHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in \u0002ve minutes more.\nLet him be at peace.\nBut the man continuing to exclaim, Down, Evremonde! the face\nof Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then\nsees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.\nThe clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed\namong the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of\nexecution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now\ncrumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are\nfollowing to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a gar-\nden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On\none of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for\nher friend.\nTherese! she cries, in her shrill tones. Who has seen her? Therese\nDefarge!\nShe never missed before, says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.\nNo; nor will she miss now, cries The Vengeance, petulantly.\nTherese.\nLouder, the woman recommends.\nAy! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear\nthee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet\nit will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,\nlingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread\ndeeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far\nenough to \u0002nd her!\nBad Fortune! cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair,\nand here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a\nwink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty\nchair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!\nAs The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils\nbegin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are\nrobed and ready. Crash!A head is held up, and the knitting-women\nwho scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could\nthink and speak, count One.\nThe second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up.\nCrash!And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their\nWork, count Two.\nThe supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out\nnext after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out,\nbut still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to\nthe crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks\ninto his face and thanks him.\nBut for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am\nnaturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able\nto raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have\nhope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.\nOr you to me, says Sydney Carton. Keep your eyes upon me,\ndear child, and mind no other object.\nI mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when\nI let it go, if they are rapid.\nThey will be rapid. Fear not!\nThe two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak\nas if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart\nto heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart\nand differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home\ntogether, and to rest in her bosom.\nBrave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last ques-\ntion? I am very ignorant, and it troubles mejust a little.\nTell me what it is.\nI have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom\nI love very dearly. She is \u0002ve years younger than I, and she lives in a\nfarmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows\nnothing of my fatefor I cannot writeand if I could, how should I\ntell her! It is better as it is.\nYes, yes: better as it is.\nWhat I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still\nthinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so\nmuch support, is this:If the Republic really does good to the poor,\nand they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may\nlive a long time: she may even live to be old.\nWhat then, my gentle sister?\nDo you think: the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much\nendurance, \u0002ll with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:\nthat it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land\nwhere I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?\nIt cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble\nthere.\nYou comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now?\nIs the moment come?\nYes.\nShe kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.\nThe spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than\na sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before\nhimis gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.\nI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\nin me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\nbelieveth in me shall never die.\nThe murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the\npressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it\nswells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all \u0003ashes away.\nTwenty-Three.\nThey said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peace-\nfullest man's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime\nand prophetic.\nOne of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea woman\nhad asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed\nto write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any\nutterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:\nI see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the\nJudge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruc-\ntion of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall\ncease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people\nrising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their\ntriumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this\ntime and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradu-\nally making expiation for itself and wearing out.\nI see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, pros-\nperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her\nwith a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged\nand bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing\nof\u0002ce, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten\nyears' time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his\nreward.\nI see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of\ntheir descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping\nfor me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their\ncourse done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that\neach was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I\nwas in the souls of both.\nI see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name,\na man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I\nsee him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by\nthe light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,\nfore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,\nwith a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this placethen fair to\nlook upon, with not a trace of this day's dis\u0002gurementand I hear him\ntell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.\nIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far,\nfar better rest that I go to than I have ever known.", "index": 44}
