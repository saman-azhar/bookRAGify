In both countries it was clearer\\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and \\x02shes, that\\nthings in general were settled for ever.\\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and\\nseventy-\\x02ve. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that\\nfavoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her\\n\\x02ve-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in\\nthe Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing\\nthat arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and\\nWestminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round\\ndozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very\\nyear last past (supernaturally de\\x02cient in originality) rapped out theirs.\\nMere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the En-\\nglish Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:\\nwhich, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race\\nthan any communications yet received through any of the chickens of\\nthe Cock-lane brood.\\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some \\x02fty or sixty yards.\\nIt is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway,\\nthere were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already\\nmarked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards,\\nto make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it,\\nterrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of\\nsome tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered\\nfrom the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire,\\nsnuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer,\\nDeath, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But\\nthat Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work\\nsilently, and no one heard them as they went about with muf\\x03ed tread:\\nthe rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake,\\nwas to be atheistical and traitorous.\\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families\\nwere publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their\\nfurniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in\\nthe dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\\n\\x93the Captain,\\x94 gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\\nmall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, \\x93in consequence of the fail-\\nure of his ammunition:\\x94 after which the mall was robbed in peace; that\\nmagni\\x02cent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols\\nfought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law \\x02red blun-\\nderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves\\nsnipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court\\ndrawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contra-\\nband goods, and the mob \\x02red on the musketeers, and the musketeers\\n\\x02red on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much\\nout of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\\nand ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\\nup long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker\\non Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in\\nthe hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the\\ndoor of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious mur-\\nderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's\\nboy of sixpence.\\nAll these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and\\nclose upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-\\n\\x02ve. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked\\nunheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain\\nand the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\\nwith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and\\nseventy-\\x02ve conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures\\x97\\nthe creatures of this chronicle among the rest\\x97along the roads that lay\\nbefore them.\", 'index': 0}\n"
